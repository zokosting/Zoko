It may also be a neglected historical centre in the downtown. You find it on ALL continents except that in some cases the officials in power, or blinkered nationalists, are in a state of self-denial - they simply say "it does not exist". To talk about it implies that one is not 'patriotic'...<br><br>Cannibal City starts like a small cancerous growth and soon takes over the whole urban body of the City, suffocates it and devours it from within. It has no rules and no imagination other than the rule of Money, of the Arbitrary, of the Obnoxious.<br>Cannibal City devours its children, treats its denizens like second-hand citizens, defecates on the doorstep, urinates in public places, defaces the buildings, demolishes the monuments, destroys the Memory. Cannibal City's Constitution is the Pre-Programmed Amnesia.<br>Cannibal City is the place where the strongest and the meanest rule with complete disregard for the Downtrodden, for Civilization, disregard for Culture, for History, for Memory, disregard for the Sacred, for the Spiritual, for Humanity. The de facto rulers of the great Game change the rules as they go along in order to stay in power for ever for so long as it suits them.<br><br>Do you live in Cannibal City, or in a part of your city which gradually is cannibalised, it is getting rid of its trees and public spaces to replace them by brutalist concrete or steel and glass soul-less structures?<br>Maybe your city is not yet completely cannibalised. Not yet!<br>Tell us about your fear that it is getting that way!<br>Tell us about it - your implication could stop it happen so that our children and grandchildren could live in a better world!<br>Naive? Maybe, but doing nothing is not going to be your saving grace!<br>Waking up to the reality may stop the faceless tyrants: it's like the lone demonstrator in front of the red tank in Tiannamen Square!<br>As you read this text and you start asking yourself questions, it may be a rude awakening, but it certainly is a good start.<br>Have a nice day and do not allow yourself to be, in turn, cannibalised!</div></content></body></html>
