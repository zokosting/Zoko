Okay, so I've got content audit that really when you directly have to start. Really like hand-holding Jonathan and making sure he does what he needs to do is his responsibility of environment as working with Bruce on the stakeholder call birds are giving them a deadline and I'm not ready for you to handle is just so you're aware because what what does the need to have is almost a matrix or spreadsheet of all the subject matter expert broken up into the different audiences the you so we can then understand see me go back to We have to focus on the content plan. We have the bottle what pages are going to migrate what we're going to get rid of what we need to move right Edge and he's going to do that work and he needs to be in charge of keeping up that communication with those people as the project progresses. One of the grants are there not shots that they have to deliver something a day for the well aware of this just proves chiming really and that's his job at the moment. He'll walk with you. Person who will go and make sure that these people are doing the example copyright that the copywriting and delivered at that they and we'll just have to make sure he's lying to you that the principal quite clear that the job has given them that they should own it. I'm trying to make sure that we don't take all the bones completely but we can still wear that what they're meant to be doing and always give them the role and when they need to deliver it by I'm actually just do like jobs into the Rock taking over because of what </div><div><br></div><div>Don't be no point having those on both physical and body for no reason. So at the moment it's a victim of gun crime that they called a piece and they should complete all the calls by a given them to the 6th of May and told many people be a girl of The Matrix by this week because I should have had a graph by lovely Friday. I don't know what confusion has been I just Have been competent but confused about something even though I literally gave them a can take to edit and tell them exactly what they needed to do. And it didn't seem to be quite clear that that's what they were supposed to deliver. Which if I find fascinating, yeah, so anyway, it's just it's not it's experience of working with them and as reasons why I've um, I've never really delivered a project with because of the way they are. I have to manage project templates to make sure they get rid of those. So that's what we happen to be on top of them and manuals is seen firsthand experience probably from them as well. Well in terms of how they Anything at all, so you don't have to treat them that there's like need to tell them everything will talk with that. But when he's be done by many for long in time to make sure they're aware that this is what they do and they won't talk and then if you don't get we need but in the dark day, you don't put books in a hole and the best way to get people to do the things which money. Well, there's a really seen is when you cannot let you booked in a hole to put that calling to invite and sometimes they say </div><div><br></div><div>Because it doesn't have to do the work by they're not come up with an excuse as to why they were on something. No, it's just want to do a comment that the problem I had you know with Jonathan it's already solved and we don't need a call later. Just want to do it. That's why I canceled it. And and now I have like the direct it contact. So it was like a back-and-forth and at the end I have to direct eye contact now and I was explaining him everything and basically what we have to do that's why I wanted to talk with horsa is like making this Banner HTML. I be sent in this violent it goes in development and that's it. And that's how easy would ya. Yeah, it's interesting pretty but dumb guy like that the result but my don't have that kind of experience and how trickle physical some of them can be. That's why I'm not being. I'm not I'm not trying to like show you how to do your job morning. It's more about understanding how people are at Big Nerd to make sure you don't get caught. I'll because I know you can be enjoyed. It's just like making sure because they'll also be the first people to complain if you missed something or to say that the wait on you to be something that actually is always nine times out of ten. They were supposed to do something better and they will they will complain to Chris then we'll come back to me and then after they will do But a problem experience that there can be something that can quite often by that. So yeah that's accepted to me one repeat it but send an email just to clarify where we are. We're going to stream a word need your help on and then but to be fine and then the other thing is that our what I need to do is put in a Call with everybody another team called and probably can't blow one up this week. Chris Carter shared a strategy document with senior manager. I kind of lost week. It's a draft document but he has asked not to share it with the team because it's cheap, but he's also told us that we can walk through the document with our team. So you're aware of what being worked on by the current thinking about the strategy about team structure how for our team look like the manual and make it my own support be questions. You have one for one as well. </div><div><br></div><div>Questions or queries that come up on the goal. I would love them down because then we do have a few in your team's back SI sessions to trick the person to get and questions and people who are proceeding stuff that you want to get feedback from everybody and look at various different segments as well. So look for the time trust like 60 something slightly wrong. But it has a section which is quite detailed. So I think it's work me booking sometimes that they get through in an hour and a half on Wacker booking to to also have questions as well. That will match my questions would likely I didn't quite it's because you're kind of what is the incentive was the strategy thinking about it looks at the </div><div><br></div><div>Pain is quite horrible feeling for the pain protests where we all really want to be and I guess what you want the mecca of that as well, which is quite good too. Just so you've got Vision, I guess the idea of division at click house. So the team as well and how yeah, no. No, it's perfect. What did you say when he wants to share this? So then he's putting a strategy session with the senior members of the team so myself. So I feel that I think in time that's like a three-hour sessions and what he wants either pushing to get our ideas, but he wanted to make sure that we share that with our team so we can ignore feedback as well. Okay, and and until when should be give you feedback or what did you say like how we organize that time for next week is due to our call to go through. I mean the session. Not got 10 until the 14th of crip. So we have a good time to cut your feedback before that. I'm going to try and see if I can get something in for Wednesday. So just knew our team meeting maybe earlier or and you see what can just looking after to go out to our the long time your call. I think it was how then I think you guys need to see it and I thought they're can't share the deck by email. You can make that. Do not share their pain. Okay. This is going to be a lot. Is there something we should think about before to call those would be directly discuss this in the cold? Is there something we should think about you know, like before or we will discuss everything like when you want to go? I think we'll just got time for stepping on certain things like the time and sometimes you go for it. So I had a quick look through and I'll get fucking pull out. His own kind of questions. I think take this journey gives you like a it does the usual Sports analysis looks at our competitors is probably what they do you all right. Look at that bookstore and I looked and how well we are for certain potential. Which talk and where where what would look like so when we'd like to be that pretty good and what better look like and then how we can be back in class basically and the period of time that might From a big investment Bible that part of a pineapple document but there's a lot of like that depth in the appendix that makes it more. Detailed It hasn't been more detail in terms of the operational model who the Playbook the German Market is. Probably what that could look like maybe pilot program. It's the whole total deck of the Handler 512 long. I think the only be for the actual overview of the strategy 67 slides long and then the rest is appendix rabbi. So yeah, let me Cement and then probably pull out here is to think about how people fall and of course, I think we can discuss the looks of it on the phone. To be honest when we're going to play the back. Yeah, I mean we can do that. And that's all I really had to be on that. The owner the other thing I have I don't think anything else is coming and I think it'd probably be part of the strategy called we had with Chris but it's just it's when it's described many of those any other requests coming in from the team outside of covid or if they're dicks has very much been all covid relate to the Muppet news come out. It's something yeah. I mean like almost everything is covid to related today. I got an and An email, I mean sometimes you know, like the last two years I was making here they are likely changes I help people so they still have my contact and then from time to time someone is asking something that is not at all covid related and and but also known as nothing big, you know, like changes down here in 30 minutes. So I don't think I have to mention that before him for Europe. I have like with Chris. I think maybe that might be part of his confession with the senior team as take time. Just how we manage the exam quite a while. There's a lot of project on there that was not being able to pick up on covid and I know what covid goes down but going to come back up and Market we're going to want to know when we can get XY they've done so and also been worried about that. </div></content></body></html>
