The Louise is that the amount all the person and that's to go through Egypt is subjective. So she we've got is the 70 people coming to us. We are not entirely sure whether these are projects. We should be trdoing if there's a line with their business. Objectives and learning what the website should do is to help them achieve this we think we always end up being very tactical that we have to just get something out while they're stepping back and saying well if you're trying to do this, it would make more sense to build it in this way. I don't think they get enough time to do that. So that caused that to happen at the end of the month and I'll point is to understand what are their priorities and to make sure that request that we get the in</div><div><br></div><div>37 lat we're not doing any of this work. Basically the second thing is to make sure they allocate budget. So what I'm very quickly finding out is that special that you get Market they have not allocated any budget whatsoever to another website request and again that a major Oversight on their salt because they haven't included us in their initial plans the first place to understand if what they want to do 20:21 will cost some extra money. So these are all the things that I want to pick up on that form with the market because the irony is that every most of the projects require them to do some form of technical change to either the</div><div><br></div><div>Either like current lineup is America or some type of change. That means we might have to get cognizant involved Melissa site. And yet they think that no matter how many times we hold a lot of the regular requesters to translation and also details pane. This information was still get requests where they've got their money allocated to work changes and most of the time if we get of the a lot of requests through that we don't have the resources to do the front and work ourselves. The option we have is the Outdoor Faucet and we're a</div><div><br></div><div>So that is the key things like this don't do anything that I need to start wanted to let you know what was happening and that's other things the one person that will help help us either bring down the amount of work that's coming in because then they should be a lot more focused. You just don't have the odds this needs to happen now, but we should have less of those. This is a lot of the work. From my perspective. I've seen the brief. These are things I've been working on all our shit. So I don't know why we're already seeing these three for this type of patient now, I think when I start to think about these things they need to engage up early so we can help shape what decision should be so hopefully there's going to be some positive outcome and that kind of potion. We've also had a lot of</div><div><br></div><div>Issues with and you have security still ongoing issue with the global site for think about cutting UK and it just highlights and more and more of the for the mighty related to the Gap that we have get support for the so again when the Rocks not to do like scans of do like a lot of it related. Huh? I have the resources that were all the skill set to do. So I keep raising it to correct because this is something that's been on my next with Chris actually since we lost my 50cm I support and it's things like what manual gets a lot with trying to find out who can help renew that sense of like, you know, exactly we get that point. A lot of Fit and request the coming through an unlocked enough to add, you know owners to the surf. It's like any issues that we need some assistance with back to help us translate that to okay what needs to be fixed so we can figure out if we go back to Publishers to help make the change that we've got lucky he hid Gap so I read this every once in a while and every teeny thing that I have with correct and I don't know what the political state is here.</div><div><br></div><div>It's going to be like a burner. So I think another one has come up is that an issue that we had with the sigma dot b site? So this is something that impacts all our website, which is a cookie Banner. The currently not compliant with the book about her that we have there was a project that was supposed to I guess get us to the point of compliance that they will ship it eventually given us what the requirements were. We work with the IP and legal to figure out what the best technical solution would be based on how complex our websites are. So the ecosystem of website, especially for the Egyptian Market.</div><div><br></div><div>That was led by contractor. He basically that put it looks better day. The contract wasn't renewed and then we had someone threatened to take us to the regulatory of the Belgian Banner. What does apply in and that's not put this project together where it's a hot potato at the moment. So nobody wants to fix really should be driven by it and legal. They don't want to take responsibility for it, but they keep asking us a like. For me what silly questions at the start the more full time we've had this conversation. So that's something that's Allure up very quickly. So these are things like trying to work on solving with so with theories help. So in case you have a theory I get his surname so we've we've got a new replacement for Bruce.</div><div><br></div><div>What if I do that but I could be wrong? It's French money.</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, I think so. Yeah.</div><div><br></div><div>Bu SS TT</div><div><br></div><div>You too.</div><div><br></div><div>Von The Ballad is coming back of the use of nonsensically when he's not be coming back. Do you do sir? And he would also put the theory so I just carried role is to help us bridge builder relationship with it team and also bridge the gap of the issues that were having. Well, they expecting me to take ownership of the things like Manuel Spanish vocal technical. That we really should be involved in but We'll come to that in a second. So I mean he's pretty new and he's got a lot on his plate especially his priority at the moment is the structure. And also now, I mean, we only had about two Messiah when he came in would be so we had to decide and also the GDP our program which is something that you put 2 cups, but very quickly without support so but he seems quite good. He's very technical he comes from an IP like p.m. Background as well.</div><div><br></div><div>It starts out like the operates and we have participants Etc is what the companies organizations as well over a native CK in Europe. But he's also has a you understand see cycle what the digital so he has like a young son how much like work in terms of build a platform expect sure. They I think will be effective is or as a lot more value and Bruce this and he's very logical. I just think we'll get a lot more out of him than we did a bruise which will help with how we engage of his team as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Now I start to get some 141 in place with him. I've got high hopes with the area. You've been pretty good and pretty on it so far, especially with what he should have had to deal with this device and you've been able to find help us to find answers or users experience to other told from teams accountable as well. Yeah. They should be really good relationship with 17. I'm now moving forward especially because Graham called run his wealth his way to Perry had very good management experience and is able to manage Graham effectively. We've been told and I think we could deduct or discussion how we did this, but we've been told if we need to engage with Graham on Fuck that. I think it depends on the level of involvement. We think that he needs to have but we should see the theory into the email for the finisher is compact. Again, I would use your discretion when you do this. I think if you think okay, we just explain to thing out. Some gravy doesn't offend me to get involved but there's an investigation piece. I would include him if we think that actually we're really should be doing this well, and he's pushing back as a suburb against communication that we think this Theory and Yeah, that's basically a desert of the pickup date. So I wanted to invest in the beginning before. Going into the P project that we have. Like, what did you say who was coming back in the gym? Sorry. I missed that. I'm definitely really dealt with this because Peter van back. Okay. He's coming back in the pot time basis. I don't know what that means in terms of his role and how we engage with hurt him and his team because in the old doctor, I don't know if that's built a structure. But before he went on sick leave Sylvia, Sylvia reported the Peter I think someone called anger. He basically build the wall be microsites portal or other acts work team. I think she reported in 2 Peter as well. So I don't know if that's going to change with Thierry there and pieces being more part-time.</div><div><br></div><div>We'll get an update when he comes back, please. Okay. Yeah, so as soon as I know a bit more I will. I will set me up there everyone in our meeting earlier. So I just wanted to provide an update. So that is so much happening. We've got all we have a lot of projects on this list and I think it just making sure that</div><div><br></div><div>There's a lot of personal aesthetic some of the major sports, but quickly some of the speeches especially for eight years some breaks alone house on standby. So just trying to Figure out this where we are the kid I could be do you want to discuss is the mystical we've had so the call that we had yesterday and then we'll all come to the Spanish total expecting. Well, how do you pronounce her name? Very the forum for me. It's also not so common name. Yeah. I cannot even remember it or something, but I've seen message me on. And then I think my son of a multi-purpose cleaner that equipment I didn't place to share your email with Chris my habitat experts about that welcomes an effective. So the Choice Solutions breed, but I dip the I haven't seen the email to a little cool idea to split so I know I think even the singer or Valerie.</div><div><br></div><div>Come back probably with some answers to some of the more I guess they could do technical questions. We heard this term before but I just wanted to get your me your feedback on the brief. And if you take time to digest what they walk through and any questions that we don't quite have that we can go back to the team to make sure we've got as much information upfront as possible. So the</div><div><br></div><div>11:19So then if it Three, we got a lot of background information which are most relevant to the brief. Some of it was just extra I guess information on a need-to-know basis. The innocent that they have a first of March deadline their initial off, it's great. Now that sounds like 200 Pages whereas in the brief that I read the it sound like it was one and been paid the design looks like it's being done by an external agency. So it looks like again they thought Graham into probably helped influence back design element, which you touch the quite high level, but it's like to be a land.</div><div><br></div><div>Page initially for NGO ideas client so the client element is the key thing in terms of I really thought it was won by a landing page different do I do it? Sounds like they have probably three or four clients that they will roll out and / members can sign up the interest for this Choice Solutions better. And the key thing that was raised that I'm a bit nervous about is the question around having I guess this book pages for quiet doorway that regardless of the clients. They've gotten virtually their own page and there might be some content that will change tailored to that client, but don't need a way to track that and looks like it's a question of how it's built so visit. Depending on how many clients into their lives. Is it easier to build a country and in it just to represent that page for each implant comes on board or do we try to think of a more strategic ways to do this, but it might require a bit more. I don't know if it means that we have to pay them and it doesn't look like they have budget to do this. So that might be an option or if they can show us how we can say</div><div><br></div><div>On a bit more with Dynamic content below and let me know if it fits with the ball. Yeah, sorry, so they would like to have like four for the clients like a landing page like this episode as this conditions and things are you know? Was it like that and you just yeah landing pages. We would have something like this. Yeah, it sounds like they would want to know not exactly a saying that you know with how we have like murder has a microphone and then I think and then the saying I guess and there's certain special. It sounds like they will have a client. So be the same landing page design expect then the content will differ depending on the client. That was a question that they had was is there a way that they could have</div><div><br></div><div>And I could take it to the client. But then the mock to serve the team or someone that team could manage basically the paper every time a new campaign before they can make the changes. It's almost like they want to template that they could manage themselves. I guess the issue is Jeff. I think with that comes back to a word of this bit is so distant I look for do we build this out on one of the things like that? It's over. I don't do what it says it on the mental health benefits and we can use that new products create a page or what this to the global. It. Looks like we have to use</div><div><br></div><div>That's a design but they are these done. So if it's not Alice were guess you're probably manage that so my issue is I don't want I don't want this to be refilled attempted for our team because if it comes down to they say now so it depends really or client support for the year, but then that's brilliant realized your business, but then SLP said to them any to accelerate this and they need to expand to GH and UK and VHS humbled by small clients each took me to come check these it's been very active of a landing page that we effectively have to replicate and edits every single time. Basically, the problem that we will face seemed like since years actually</div><div><br></div><div>Bobby has already always greeted like a new landing page. Based on to the old one. So we created one template and always based on that we made changes but I have to say like this concept is equal. So how do you say like went a bit out of hand?</div><div><br></div><div>And the thing is like with all the little changes in constantly. They asking you I could do here this could you update is good you add and file your update is there if this is not in a Content management system somehow then I think for us it is would be like something really quite time consuming, but maybe it would be a good moment now to think about and I solution for us and maybe how we can build this in a different way than than the words of learning.</div><div><br></div><div>For example As I would also recommend recommend to see a music this is somehow possible. But the thing is the visibility, right? So this was so far was the biggest issue that that should not be like visible for public. So not sure like how we can either gate this or make it more visible not index it or I don't know like this and that but I don't think it's been visible the problem. You can stuff it just can't be. Heart of a folder so almost it as a awesome page like this single page of the main domain similar to how landing pages that on comes up did not come. The problem we have is depends on where it's at. You're still better have budgets to do anything and it will still be if it's on the inside unless we can you Email confirming that the I didn't go for the components of schools. That would be the committee bill that's not be a cost so you can have a design so we can set so and then also the design they showed I mean we can influence that our but I don't know if the design again it's something that it's specifically what they want. But there's obviously if it's if it's been like that speeds up form of the verb four.com. A template that we have to follow I mean they use that Spanish sighs example, which is quite a long landing page.</div><div><br></div><div>I mean at the moment, I mean EG early, I would like to discuss like a task that we already have like six months and I'm the least here like create our own templates for 4-Piece kind of tasks and I have to feeling like that at every month. They're like other markets coming with these kind of ideas and they always send us a different design from a different agency and I simply if you always follow that and we have to really trust busy creating new and Value Patriots and I mean, sometimes they come out of the blue like we some designs from a random agency and I don't even know like like whether or not working with the signal internal design team for example, and all the designs are different and I think it would be better the other way around if we have maybe some customized customized components. Maybe we think about some place and the great them like one time we have to invest a little bit but then we would have like sandbox system. I'm like this and and we could give them here. These are all the components you can play with them and you have to think about the inside this sent box to create a new client landing pages in this is what we offer and if you need a certain spot extra component and maybe you have to pay for it, but I think we should like put them a bit more limit them a little bit, you know with their fantasy. That's a and always there something new coming up and we have to adapt and I think the other way</div><div><br></div><div>Wrong to be better today are up to us and we offer them but I think at some point we have started because otherwise we always have like this in between Solutions and not sure like that is Page could sit but ideally I would like to have like a generic website where all the markets can publish their the pages somehow. They're like a URL where there is not Language or Dogma It's specific like a generic one. I don't know what this could be and there we could build like all these landing pages for each market.</div><div><br></div><div>Depending on the market.</div><div><br></div><div>Or we can use this camera.</div><div><br></div><div>Which project which one? Already used to make Nick question. Can we use for home which them as right because we want to have all the components beneath. But with yeah, we do have a complaint would be for example something like technical oval and then slash and in the market and then the website, I mean signal Global, I'm not sure like how the structure how we should structure this out.</div><div><br></div><div>We think would be the best place but the issue is not with the teams like but in fact connection so it's okay. Well so for again, the other thing is so they met yourself for both table instant we connected on using social storm and I wasn't around that. So do we have to trade if it was formed always going to be something but we have to create from Yeah, because it's building a component because of all the connections that there's no point. That would be something that we have to do. But is it just me quote form? And I know they did this for and do I do didn't we or similar but we do from a different event. Do I do so on the thick? No health benefits from fly. I know there was a forum on bad, but we're back to that. Was that busy do any changes to the form there or great a new form?</div><div><br></div><div>Are you asking for sir, or?</div><div><br></div><div>Not sure.</div><div><br></div><div>What?</div><div><br></div><div>Okay.</div><hr><div>Oh, come on. Come on. Come on my leg. I don't know what can be done and probably can help also the case of if they show for example Jose houses to help us put in a solution to the war end up building. Sorry. Hello again. Can you hear me now? Right. Sorry, sorry admins. And is what you say in sorry?</div><div><br></div><div>Do it. Yeah for Cigna health benefits. Are you talking about Cigna health benefit do you mean that? Okay. Yeah. Yeah signature. Yeah Cigna health benefits in that. There is another original web page not with no problem. Okay, so for Cigna health benefits, I just want to be sure that Bad era of the requested one to use that original web page because it exists. It's already exists. He wants that we won we upload anything. So for Cigna health benefits, there is an original web page and then okay. Yeah time ago. We just replicate that to include. Well the</div><div><br></div><div>Elmo and all the all the changes the demanders</div><div><br></div><div>We need to just go ahead I guess the question is framed what needs to be delivered to how we limit the impact of after issue saying that it was too big for clients with the share is confirming that the case that there isn't going to be an exhibition for more if there is some we're going to have to say to her you need budget against this to look at something that's sustainable.</div><div><br></div><div>11:36Thinking that has like that for that because at the moment because I think that's just where we're going to stay still enough to figure out. And I think we need to get back to have a questions that we have today. If you guys look at a brief again any questions that you have based on the conversation we had yesterday and just go back to her especially understanding make sure you understand the use of the word. So when someone submits a so thankful, what forms will do when you have a face we don't have an idea of what those are when someone commits the form.</div><div><br></div><div>What is the character and the front end and the back end and where does it need to go into the furnace itself? Or? Okay, how are we going to do that select another going to give us a web form is an elephant form that what the integration you doing speak to who's going to help us share that and then what the track and it needs to be passed acts of while. Because I think what we could do is eat to build someone in a team to work out if there is a way to reduce the workload so you can effectively maybe have one page with shared content block or dynamic content block, but we have to identify what</div><div><br></div><div>It would be and then also if they need to track the individual client from what angle trying to get what the tracking requirement that needs to be built in do that and it's just the worst rate of the if it's a lot of work. There is the same amount of work to do that. It'll take us longer than it is to just replicate the same page or five times for now. I don't know. That's fine. But I think initially it's been one client that we have to build both, but that's actually not in the net so much he come up in the summer time and I've got one full day of the year. She said so we just need to get that facing if the workflow spaced out that it might just be something after that. We can simply manage for now while we tried to work on the Strategic and Creative Group. And I could we build so we saw the missile pay for them for the first of March and work against work on what's required when the next time it comes up. I think that's just kind of focus will need you guys to have with easy to speak to fill or someone in your team. You can help trying to solve for</div><div><br></div><div>We can get up to go live. And then how can we adapt it case the route the workload increases? Both of them were clients.</div><div><br></div><div>And you talk about the dynamic dynamic content. You sure like to go to like a simple solution that we had for the stress campaign, right? So like depending on the URL, like if there's like an addition in the URL, then the the content might change and like this we could create Dynamic content for each client. Yeah, it's a kind of yeah, exactly. So if the if it's like, okay, well they said yeah, the name of the there needs to be some to have to be some unique identifier to say if you get some traffic comes from this thing called it ID whatever then locate specific information, but it dissipates of working out what if it's a manual, but it'd be quicker. Get out of the door, but not probably what we have to do in the interim until we have a loan that day because that whole landing page. I spoke to said about the its own benefits as well. But it's Bob down the list that we would have to really work with them on what the is what those pages will be on elephant. I guess the person is also is elephant the right platform for the yeah. It's like we're trying to make things on the team site. That is how can we make?</div><div><br></div><div>But it depends on websites like the market side as well as an accident. I'm not really what language this point yesterday. You mentioned like the issues with Salesforce in eloqua. I wasn't a hundred percent sure like what you were referring to because like so far we could connect like white every like Salesforce this in a lockbox the forms. Okay, that's why I guess it depends on what the connection is that for example, when we would do with the breath originally we we didn't have a connection between eligible to the IP myself from instant very had a connection to the B2B instance so data. I think that's because the form was an edible form happy passed in 2004 as well. As I guess when you guys are building landing pages now, you're using cell phones heard, right? So someone will start easy sell for code and you implement that into the into the landing page. Yeah. Yeah, I mean so far it was like you said that I mean you have perform action basically and so we have like one form the</div><div><br></div><div>Up and they're inside this form. You can change certain parameters. Let's say if you send it back to a local to Salesforce. I mean lately for several small doing that. So I think he was doing it the same way as before so I wasn't really sure like what you meant is the connector like all the connection between a dog whines Salesforce or if you talk about a certain autonomy the mentation Anymore, but we don't have it just in case I'm not I don't know what they'll for that. They were backdated repented. Faucet I think you were setting up the last pictures. I think the only thing that you did is like in the in the in the form you just change the action know like the form action and you put in the the Saints also have a meters and connect this with all the fields and everything right to set it up. Hmm. Yeah the fact it's a little Li little bit more complex, but briefly we just need to Put that code to send the data to sales for or to eloqua with different behaviors and different fields and different programming but at this moment we have already some kind of templates so we can send both to sales for or to eloqua. There is no major issues in do it any Nothing, but I'm not sure if the question is related to connect the data of eloqua and Salesforce. I'm not sure if this is the question.</div><div><br></div><div>Because there are two different platforms and they are two different database and some time ago some time ago. I was request to investigating on that. I mean to connect somehow both different databases and not sure if that's the issue here. So the thing is like at the moment what we can do is thanking dive into the data from Lowepro form. I mean from landing pages on the clock, but the form is sending directly data to Salesforce and but then the form data is not saved in an aqua so that the analytics later and the reporting and all these things. It's not in Allah Akbar. I think this was the issue and we want to have that connection.</div><div><br></div><div>You also see like all the data coming in it. Yeah, exactly. So I think this is the the issue that we had about sending directly to Salesforce. We are in a long form is no no problem here we've done in the past, but they did. Eliquis The base of talk is through and a couple protect yourself or not depends on making sure that the elephant have the inspiration to that specific cell phone system that will always be proud. Yeah, I think it's we don't have to solder the battery the t-72. It might just be a case of if we connect it with the next to it. We were able to capture today.</div><div><br></div><div>So it's not about your team. And yeah, I mean, this is something important. I seen like to differentiate if it's like only reported other the function itself of sending the data to say it's possible. Yeah. Yeah. No, I just was saying technically it is it's the same to send the local to send Salesforce, but we have no business ability on the creation of that form. So we do not now the leads or anything else or where are you going exactly? Okay, that's fine. So in terms of leading on this project, he wants to take the lead on that have gotten the old with Valerie and if they're just go back to again makes me go back with questions that you have wanting to know they've gotten the brief so we can actually determine what's of what we can do but now just to get so deep make the decision the decision at the end.</div><div><br></div><div>I caught somebody said look like if the data of Salesforce is not visible in the low Providence Angels itself, like these kind of questions. Should they make the decision or is it something that you come from us now? We can make the decision that they brought this to speak claro basically just being clear because what we don't want them to do is say oh especially if there's an issue with the connection and then use the lead and they're thinking that there's a record of them. In an aqua, but we don't have an integration to that instance. We're not going to have that record for these are things that come up post-launch. I want to move to help them solve for that. But then those would just be if there's an issue and we'll just be lovely to be whatever a record goes back in our DB it's going to connect to that in itself will be okay and basically also tell them about the solution of the dynamic.</div><div><br></div><div>Clients landing pages and like separate landing pages. Basically, I think with stuff like this stuff that we need to investigate. We yeah, we need to investigate it's our job to tell them what the best solution based on so, I guess I'm not a mix of factors that we've got a deadline to her. We roughly know that okay release a client slowly or this though. There's the option of my newly replicated face. Ages, but we don't want it to become a feel for how was at stake but these days but now you only need the one page we will do that post feeding or deadlines and then but we need to understand when the other parts are going to be rolled out and if that number changes, you know in the second half they come back and say actually we've got five more people to add there. We need to go back and revisit that you need to put money against this design effective way of building this because for now they don't have any funding so</div><div><br></div><div>The practice pages will learn if they had fun. Then. I would have preferred to God for a more sustainable solution that gives them control over the content that we can build it once and never live up to those expectations. So we just have to explore your options are and then we get backed up today. This is what we think works based on at Giant that that makes sense. So that's our job, but I don't necessarily decide based on what your footsies explored. This is how we think they should be and this is what gonna work.</div><div><br></div><div>11:50And the timing so I guess the main thing from today's meeting was to go back either with any further questions that we would have.</div><div><br></div><div>They don't have the discount and if they need more we would have to think about like like Edition. But yeah the questions we need to ask someone will call but we need to just speak of these questions on an email. So it's a case of and it has body looks like we have to build it bear it in mind.</div><div><br></div><div>For the wet pavement have we need to confirm what the phase is how many clients they predict they'll have rolled out for the year. I want the statement of those that I'll be saying that first of marked as 1 by n then by May they'll have another fire and by September don't have him walk if it's got back to plan in advance. It makes it easier to plan out. Okay resources so we know that this is going to come. What are those changes as well? What will the proposed changes be so they need to be specific. So again, it's going to help us determine how we build this Dynamic content block or you're going to replicate these Pages because it's easier, you know, what elements of the code will be shared across the top or the science of what elements would be specific to the science. That will determine</div><div><br></div><div>It was the we also have to be within our skill sets that we know we're not really strong with we don't know elephant that well to figure out how a dynamic content work will figure out their content block for them back and tracking and that needs resource that you have to pay for that and the budget for that then that's going to discount. So in down that room that's going to Discount going down and more sophisticated group. We know that we can't do that work ourselves, but I don't have the budget to pay for that work now. So that might be of a conversation that you revisit in the second half of the year. If it looks like having more people come on board which is different to what they told us. And now they need to make sure that they can find Budget to allocate to this because we can't maintain building.</div><div><br></div><div>Spending 20 landing pages make the changes every single time and how many could be convinced to like you said like and as an example like One landing page and then we would have to think about the additional budget to create more based on that or maybe to make it Dynamic. I think it depends on what they come back with. The main thing is the case has been quite clear having a fan up front. How many clients do the year? Is it going to be? B Connecting come back but often and we can make a decision and say okay. Well we can school based on all the answers that come back baseball questions. This is the route forward. This is what will be the MVP and then what we can look at as a face to but you need to budget for it. This is how much we can manage for you in this time frame to these are the things that we need to be more strategic with going back with questions are getting the right answers and they're not our thinking needs to need to display. You know, what was it?</div><div><br></div><div>That's attractive. Yeah, no, I can do this then.</div><div><br></div><div>I got something against it. They want to lead on it depends how comfortable you are. You've done quite a lot of projects. So it's up to you. If you want to own a bit more manual again depends on the work work. There's a lot of stuff we've got coming in you do a bit of time with this one. So just making sure we can get as much information as possible fairly quickly. So we don't go Rush towards the end. You've got to really drive to say okay the content when we need the content by making sure again, we've got standard analytic Santos perfectly fine. So, you know, what account would is going to need to fill in I don't believe would need to pull in the analytics team on this one. So, I don't know. I mean maybe I mean Depends for example, if you have like the stomach content or something like this.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe we won't be also have And about a different solution for the for the analytics. I mean, I'm not sure but who knows like I can produce also the list. I mean course adjust regarding the lead of this task or project. Yeah, do you feel comfortable to do this? Would you like to do that? I mean I could send you like all the notes that I made and you could discuss this before if you want and then you could lead this if you want. Okay, okay.</div><div><br></div><div>Manual for supporting years if you need to that and then you can offer support and you can have like, you know tactics and didn't your packed up for you might be but it might just be a good one. Bye.</div><div><br></div><div>A pressure. This is what I just want to put it out there but it won't be to of this. All right, you're around a lot of doing but don't get to have influence on the Collegiate position on some things. I note the small project that. Okay. Okay. No problem. Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. It's like it's okay like yeah, most of this information gathering and all these kind of things. So it's nothing like critical. Yeah, because of the war. Yeah, exactly.</div><div><br></div><div>The other item that's coming. But we've got busted for your information. But this whole house. Recent documents So we've had initial call know the senior team and for ages 18 to understand what it is. What the Whole Health thing is what the brief is the tribes that time were the three Supply. This is what we're saying that they need budget for and working with so amazing the figure out what the best approach is based on.</div><div><br></div><div>Anthony's make that we have so as usual. We don't have much information it almost think that they want to replicate something similar to the structure house. And that could be a basis for like a template design with you know, Immaculate depending on what the content is. We've got no clue or something is different is that there's a multilingual requirement that they want to have which I think would be a space to do initially. They want some not just English. We're trying to figure out basically an MVP to get their deadline which is at the 50 Series.</div><div><br></div><div>Pushing back on that deadline, but we know that we're going to have to commit to it. So we don't really want to waste time waiting for having the benefit of quantity. We're just trying to figure out quickly what we can do, but I'm just I'm leaving this initially just to get to the place with Bill and being on this is what we thinks going to work and it's what we suggest because the easiest market-based left it to us to make that decision.</div><div><br></div><div>And then again manual really up to you and money and I do want the basic pick it up by the project manager in it. So working move things and the market in terms of getting the acid look requires over to make sure we can hit deadlines, but I would also like for with the team on Friday this week, so if you Look at the break, but it's going to change it to it. But just look at me aware of what I'll help actually is. And next time</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, they do and then you just let me know that if he wants to basically leads on the delivery of it. So we're not doing the bill again. It will be working with thing. But I guess similar to listen to stuff we're working with and the analytics team. I'm still technically using the structure harm as a science of flight different than what we're trying to figure out is they actually have a requirement. So there's gonna break out look like they need to track their need to basically But it's audio. So what I do she wanted to be which the won't be able to do is I want to tap it of the global.com, but we won't be able to because of the multilingual requirements because they needed ongoing budget for any updates. And also they've got Portuguese in they have we don't have that and after I pee stepped up and won't be able to do so, what did you get me another L Aquila thing, but we were An app ways to absolutely cases that is audience. So it's like a what the iaea looks like all this basically so you were almost looking at replicating the navigation the top level navigation specific local or this we were walking around with what we've been doing but we're seeing is basically that home breakout would work but then each individual that each user group has their own I guess. Landing page with relevant content for them and then you click into the various templates of the video series of blog section enough perception applaud competitions webinar. So very similar to the structure hard, but just we're just trying to understand what will be where it will fit.</div><div><br></div><div>It would be so Jennifer you tasting and be increasing and at what the link out would be to the product that sexy talk to protect the peace that we have with the microsites accept their help with an our help with this as well. So read agree. Let me know what questions you might have. I can still forward musical work. I'm going to have the same just so you're aware of your conversation that's happening if he wants to destroying anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>It's not something you want to do. The Whole Health thing is going to be a growing tea. So let's just tell you feel something initially and then it'll expand expand on it is a very important project for the Eid gift pain Orion is pushing them have something ready by separate the key one, which is where the deadline of the picnic but in practice they have some delays. From the brand team in the US which held them back which is why I come to work quite late.</div><div><br></div><div>The - one but if we can pre-plan like what they will now work with the blocks around politics, at least we've got a solution an idea and then it tapers building and waiting for some friends. So we can share that idea. So what would they shed idea with? Reading the pain make sure they're all happy with it. And I think we'll do that.</div><div><br></div><div>We should be lead is this bro? Check? I mean reset like any of us, but Yeah, just to organize as well now. Not sure. Yeah, that's a nice cake he would meet with them. So you'd imagine TV went missing. So just depends on he wants to.</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, we</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, I mean I was also thinking that because I was involved in the stress scale one. So I guess if you know like all the background analytics like the solutions they found here and there so they could make it exactly like you say like at the beginning you could make it together to get bored. And then when you're familiar with everything, maybe you can monitor for it.</div><div><br></div><div>12:04Yeah, I need it every now and then we discuss if there are questions. This fine integration. I mean, I'm not familiar with integration integrated project. So yeah.</div><div><br></div><div>Everything is updated and organized. Yeah, definitely area on Friday. You said you would have a meeting with yeah for the invite bu and math and Molly I'll kidnap just want to ask is extensively involved. We're just trying to get ahead. So what I want to do this year is I want to lean on you guys a lot more because I'm getting pulled in.</div><div><br></div><div>Directions affect the find out how I want them smile and and if they kick off their migration and that's taking a lot of time. I'm also trying to figure out what cy7. So they would do is restrict immigration problem of these different spots on access to be like move forward to get stuck. We have to find alternative. So I've been helping Sylvia he's been leading on that. It helped them when they speak about the ground customer coming to our team to help support, but that's probably more when they start building that we need to get involved. I'm just trying to start a few things. Well, we're getting stuck in Egypt Mark except so for work, so I literally want to do it once. I'm now saying he wants to lead us because I actively what you guys put your hands on the second call. I'm going to take this on and the whole point is not politely Be Wondering blowing in the wind stops not knowing what to do. It's a case of take it as far as you can pull up in when you need support of what question or need a taught needs up during a fall. We're a team. We're all here. We're all learning. I learned I don't have all the answers all the time. So a lot of times when like my emails I come back so, you know, I'm fine with a position to make it because I actually trust you guys to do your job site.</div><div><br></div><div>My team I see you guys as an expert in your field. I don't want to micromanage. But you know, we'd like have a whole year together. I've been out how you guys operate you're already good at your dog divert organized and logical drop the right questions that sometimes you just need a bit more of a push through structural self and to really push yourself to think more autonomously on a lot of projects or two.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm Elvis Alicia when I jumped in a lot of times it's because I know okay. Chris is doing this. I want to make sure that you guys are the best or I might comment from a different angle to say I don't think that's a little work and that's kind of the thinking I want you guys to do as well. So it's not leaving you hanging. It's just Casey leaning you guys a lot more than I probably did last year. It shows a level of trust by having you guys. So that's going to be quite there on that could have some calls eventually like join initially and drop off the like morning takes a lot of these issues forward like with the Egypt redesign morning essentially took a lot before for the and by herself confusing the in the detail of the project youngster lot of areas and then still come back and check with me and that's kind of relationship. I want to have a lot of time with you guys.</div><div><br></div><div>When you get stop when you see a problem coming up, but it might not be an issue yet. You want to kind of discuss the options then like only in or: and that's kind of how I work with Chris. But Chris is never in that the school. I want to know if it was the detail their Crystal purpose for a high-level guy. I can't really work that way but I don't want to micromanage my pain because that's just not what I'm about our trustees to yourself as well as I believe in you guys even more Yeah. They would like even have not found that I've got stolen how you do your work - I know your daughters like at home. You might not be able to get her into back into a nursery for any time soon. So again, you have been able to do the work. No problem while you're you know, and you've got back up to now but I understand there has to be flexibility as well. But I just want to make sure that the seam even though you might not be leaving on a budget if you can still lose each other in certain cases prosaic. Can't work because he's got an emergency you take the rest of the day off it can still move forward for a bit between come back and the likes of you balling and maybe well myself as well. So what I'd want to use these I'm going to make these P meters longer quite a lot. Why won't you did pee meter for receive the block effective highlight any concerns or issues? So apart from this high level of other projects you're working on to not be tail, but</div><div><br></div><div>Because there's a issues like he birthday party for you and then we can use them time to flush out any service think that might have Arisen but you wanted to stop and you haven't had time to look at all. You wouldn't let me know about as well come up Maria. And at this point I was just thinking not sure if it's a stupid idea when you say like we want to have like this meeting a bit longer because like over we need a bit more time. Do you think it makes sense to have maybe on Tuesday and Stay like one like each one hour meeting so that we have not everything back only one time a week, but maybe two times so that there's not so much space in between the long meetings rather. Maybe two shorter ones. I mean one hour is also a lot but maybe like this be a more in touch like frequently. I'm not sure what you think about it on that red of just one but where We could do that. I wouldn't be able to make all of them all the time. So That's why I started almost to work more. Yeah. I think you can step up that sort one doing I guess I guess my mind if there's more availability that he'd probably say my diary. I would not even end of January and I've got to start spending an inordinate. We will be passed the got like <span>training</span> in my afternoon. So the morning I'm going to have to inform the work.</div><div><br></div><div>And they money depends on your</div><div><br></div><div>It's just want to say that I like I still have like five or six points here on my list that I actually wanted to clarify not necessarily to do likewise the task that we have here, but like questions that I would like to go there talk with you guys and I always do I've got these things. Yeah. I've got the next 15 minutes 3</div><div><br></div><div>It's coal, which I don't normally do because of all the work coming in. Yeah. Yeah sure. I'm sick. I mean the whole it is hard like directions. Sometimes I'm working with some of them thinking. Oh my God. It's so complicated to work. Why don't you maybe do this and then I would like to discuss this with the team, but often we just goes through the most important things and all the little things they They are not discussed and I think it also makes sense. I mean here I had this in my smartsheet for example.</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, like this one ones advertisement saying yesterday you were mentioning in the emails that like you want to go through what words Patrick was talking about like the last months or something. It was like pushing more last week or two weeks this back and forth and I just wanted to clarify, you know, you're talking about the one ones advertisement seeing or is there something else behind it? Because I said something earlier that the one month was the second wave. That was that through.</div><div><br></div><div>I think what's the girl code? Teachers right and a brand of a that yeah that they wanted the Friday night at 9:00 not been acquired and I said well the viewer and come back to them you can do it and I sold like yesterday. It's connected like we someone C11 sing. A lot of times did he just he just um despite. Diinya, and it doesn't take initiative. So he literally just been day now. Don't know how to do work that he really should be doing. And PC under the management of the so what should we say here? Look at that very very you guys can look at it and just check that. You've got the information. You need to go back to get the answers and then they spaced on basically have to make decisions based on the information you need. Is it enough information to start the work? When do you think you can deliver it based on our priorities because a lot coming up? If you've got the space to do it, I don't know what the answer was. I honestly I didn't bring my email. It was not that much. It was from Alba but it's like you're connected mr. The other European business and it's basically just updating Pages nothing new. It's like a change and I was going through a briefing document and it's like existing Pages you have to be able to have to update. Like certain offers because they were talking about I think similar offers like the one month one the campaign. So now they want to get rid of all this campaign stuff like here 15% 20% in this kind of things and they have they have to change that because the campaign is no longer active and this is like a simple</div><div><br></div><div>Yesterday I was actually putting all the information here, but it got some power over written and there's nothing in English because writing not sure if I have it. There's no longer an attachment here. Actually yesterday. I put all the put it actually under this one here, but I think it got somehow on overwritten.</div><div><br></div><div>Let me look at that.</div><div><br></div><div>I had to do that's a big mess trying to to find out what's going on. Yeah, because of things that Could it be right to the email?</div><div><br></div><div>So based on the face Yeah, exactly. Like that is and II think this is the briefing document and here they talked about these two websites UK have X and Inspire and they basically want to have like changes done and I think it's basically only what what we can see here. And I want to have like certain things change like the commission change back to 59 and this kind of stuff. So I guess it looks like it's not loaded. It looks like if you can do this like in one hour or so, but I would have to double check it again. So it basically is just an update of where the expired campaign you think. It's something that can be done by Monday or Tuesday. Yeah, for example.</div><div><br></div><div>The other phonetically</div><div><br></div><div>I was told that was my main thing was to see of 17 when we don't do anything else. So annoying by the fact that they expected it to be done. And then I sent the proposal on one like Monday Yeah by Friday that that's an assumption that we're not doing anything. So</div><div><br></div><div>12:19And if we think it can be done then we'll come back to you. But we we should take one because through it not be told they have to be done by the state. I've had a confessional correct, so I didn't really good to be bad. So I had to seen it be something quick. Yeah, I've been practicing.</div><div><br></div><div>Sorry, I just wanted to add I just want to add something here and it says take a look at this request. Okay, I have some questions because so I guess the amount of time to do this task will be a whole day of work. I mean full-time day of work because there is there are some Some questions that the requester has also clear.</div><div><br></div><div>First we need to change two pages in each market. You can see that for DH you can you must change the landing page and also the thank you page. So this is this is the first this is the first thing and the second question this second thing is there are some misunderstanding there. Due dates to be changed so we should ask the requester to clarify. What she can do what she want to do? Okay, so I have made some kind of a screenshot with the changes that she talks about here, but we should clarify we should clarify with her the exact changes she wants to do. So, this is a this is a first step and the second step is to make all the changes. So I guess we</div><div><br></div><div>I make it in just one day I mean a full whole day. I mean eight hours of work, so In fact, we can we can make our best to make it ready natural tomorrow or this Friday. But as you say Maria, we cannot we can well take a corner of our work law.</div><div><br></div><div>That's true.</div><div><br></div><div>This week we have any deadlines for this week. That's what they want. Let me see. We have a couple we have some changes for ETS.</div><div><br></div><div>Some changes for DHS the French quotation page also, they covid-19 Services learn should dates and but we are waiting answer for the requested. So and also the brake seed footer today. Okay answer yes room. Oh, yeah, exactly and the one month campaign that this tax, they will be ready for this week that they issue here the point here is this request. Came to us before of the of the broker Pages briefing. So we we should take care of there before of the broker pleasures. Yeah, exactly. So not sure we can make our best. To get it ready this week making our best as I said, but well not not sure if we should do that.</div><div><br></div><div>We have to have delivery Authority deliberate. But if we would have been able to complete the average that I destroyed a we had completed by the next available date we have on do the work with the and you tell them what that date the stage that we need.</div><div><br></div><div>We need the requester to clarify like a few things. Okay. So yeah, maybe by Tuesday or so next week they could use to clarify everything. I mean if it's possible, I will be some back and forth to maybe until Friday. We have everything and then next week Monday Tuesday. We could use on making the changes and it makes that clear.</div><div><br></div><div>We should be able to do to complete the work by drop by 2. That is 26 based on the fact that will have all occurred stations and everything that we require by the 12th grader the 22nd. Okay, I'm a great. Okay, and then I can jump in. I think I'm saying it because again then we'll have all the deadlines. The point is we can get it out there because it respects finished by the 26. It means that we've got the time. The resources are allocated to other deadlines that we want to have depleted that we Okay, great. These requests that came first ages ago. They've got completion date. We've done our part, but you're still waiting on us.</div><div><br></div><div>After all those people we were getting chased by legal or not break the update become choir.</div><div><br></div><div>And then there's other things worse between us to impress them to deliver even pre-Christmas that we said. No, we can deliver afterwards they were going to fire and this is my whole point, which is also something I'm going to raise with the market is every time</div><div><br></div><div>But then they never fix that that line and that's a problem for us to impact the rest of our work, but then I'm going to be putting forward blowing the pain to be quite clear that we're not there. Not the only Market that we serve it but not their skivvies to be work. We have other markets that we also support so Sam thinking that They can hold us up when were expected to finish work by certain time. It's unacceptable. So these are the scissors wire push back because they're just taking the mix. I don't like it basic things and have a right that they those requests came in first. We need to get them off our table. We've done our part but the chase those people are to make sure it</div><div><br></div><div>I think that's that happening that's completed before we went on the next project.</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, let's let's do okay. Let's get back to them try to get everything by Friday and then next week we can make the rest. But yeah.</div><div><br></div><div>Not Maria, like like fixing it. Do you actually know if you can also use this dis Google form that that other teams are using to get you know, the the breathing and everything done so that we have like this on Lansing maybe even how they're allowed to do that because we wanted to use Google see it will form a credit pack of Berkeley said no, Google. Okay, we're not allowed to use because I'm topic major but I have no idea. I raised it before I am I have no idea how he's going to and from that. I need ignored me. Basically, I really yeah socks off him when he sees that because he flipped out like so but there is something similar with Google Sheets and ignored me. So I mean, this is the Young Yeah, I don't want to do it because Chris Barnes out. He's gonna go ballistic, but first to me regularly and our work always get back to Chris so we would be the ones who will be found out why great political views the more that any want to risk that.</div><div><br></div><div>No. And he can we not give to me great. Our own other perform ourselves. Do we really need things out about I mean, the only thing is like I was thinking like if you're creating that I mean it should work like properly and like I would also like to use it later on then 444 report by God for analytics so that you can email. Yes, of course.</div><div><br></div><div>Easy, so you have to create an email and You get an email and then we have to ask but I would like to have also this connected somehow to some sort of database or something like this very can analyze everything that we see how long like each tasks took. I mean, maybe they can make a face one or two and two because other than that to get it done fast or something like this. I don't know so not sure I think Build for just drop into a deferred the backside with their database and then they talked to reported to look at that.</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I will think about like some sort of workflow like like it like an idiot workflow and then we can maybe reduce it to two what's possible now and then C Phase 1 and Phase 2 or something like this, but I would like to write down maybe like an eternal workflow like how everything would work like perfectly and then we can see what's realistic and not and maybe</div><div><br></div><div>Like divided in a fast and as solution and anaphase 2</div><div><br></div><div>And maybe we can discuss it next week in the team meeting and then to get your opinion also on the yeah.</div><div><br></div><div>It's a bit bigger than a cup of this but never for what other items that you want to put the grave. Yeah, like yeah, I mean he saw to the Spanish maturation was one thing that I want to have like mature if there's anything Bland but for me, it's like just a pain to work with this agency in Spain because like that, they're not really helpful and</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, it's just takes a lot of time to get things done and Drupal exactly.</div><div><br></div><div>That will be supporting really not doing as much as people to Easier by one and Thailand. So the market that have butter and It could change but that's what it is so far because I guess it depends on the nature. We have the easiest Market on both the what will happen with the any other great things happening every other note, but people just the market. Everybody's got business project. Yeah. Yeah, that basically does like</div><div><br></div><div>Professor instructor that is I know that carefully maybe that kind of silly but the owner of self goes for the Middle East I think the kill So you've worked the kill before the kill like ni a reality, but he responded 50 with the invoice email of similarly budget that competent be working on New Circle using all the track. Yeah to the right person.</div><div><br></div><div>I mean like like a sickness like trust his baby. We have like always with like troubles to figure out like who can help us with certain status for things. It's a bit messy for the header called yesterday with and trying to clarify a few things. And and yeah, I every now and then we had like an issue with special events many technical things and we're like you said lead generation and Pretty happening very much. Driver to Y so all I know that I know I didn't knew that there was a Spanish instance when Larry was and choosing when I be spoken to about that though. It's okay. I was I was basically I also had access to Salesforce and I also know how it works more or less and you can imagine like in the Spanish team. They were like the Salesforce people work.</div><div><br></div><div>Mr. Lead generation Basically setting up the campaigns and Salesforce, but Lira and I agree were responsible for the technical side. Basically the connection with the campaigns and helping. Yeah, everything that related to connect this with Salesforce. So there are they re and I were you always like making this bridge between their sales force team and we do the that technical side and then layer left and she was basically setting up a lot there. And also like with all the other things she left me basically a bit meteor Without Really knowing what she know. Yeah. Now I'm also responsible for this anymore. So it's an and they didn't really call this a exchange knee or found us like obviously like a different person like what I yeah, it's</div><div><br></div><div>Exactly this situation and Jose's often in the middle of everything and I also don't know really answers. Yeah, and yeah, it's certainly true that foot in Spanish says for a Spanish Salesforce. There were it is a kind of black hole for us because we have no access or I have no access. I have no visibility on what can be done of different configurations. And we do not really know who is in charge of or what can do.</div><div><br></div><div>12:36Okay, I will but I thought after going to bump it bump it back to I either so this is basically the Spanish cell 4 exactly. Yeah, I mean like that the whole Salesforce European team basically, like how do they work?</div><div><br></div><div>I'm fine, not the problem because it has a different belt. Fulfills a different self defense has a separate team. I pay my which is dih dih. Can we well that does it for adults will take the product, you know who owns that Jesus talked with guys off, but Jenny might be able to help you get caught right so after And then the Diego's so that was originally by like some of whom are eons in the state. And that was that the B2B incident. So I think that includes like the UK like dhb which is ld8 and the Middle East but the Middle East took ownership of the ROM version which at the time the been given to me was likely feel this pain is always been</div><div><br></div><div>One No, I know.</div><div><br></div><div>And I do anything last year. So it's like another running around trying to figure out but there's also a GC GHP still course admin email. That was given. I just don't know if they the idea it's the will not I don't think anything to change with those bits. The pain</div><div><br></div><div>But I get the focus on the one you're trying to sell gold that would get sound like it's saying that you face the all speak to correct him if he knows her name of something, but basically the no doesn't seem to be anyone in Spain. Bonus Soulful. That's not the issue. I mean, it's more the issues like the responsibilities within the the whole sales force team and and who can do vote and food because sometimes they seem to be a bit overwhelmed with certain questions or they push it back to us. And we think know they should be able to do certain things. So like a point of contact, you know, that that can help us with all related cells for things in Spain and almost exactly the person maybe they don't have</div><div><br></div><div>This person yet or something like this and if we can if we need to make</div><div><br></div><div>No, no, I just want to add that if we need to make any change, we should need also some kind of <span>training</span> or some kind of support or <span>training</span> to do that.</div><div><br></div><div>It's not really our job to oversell for yeah, but not picked out team. So I have two patients. No.</div><div><br></div><div>The these things to Christina when it comes to saying yes, she's always in and I was actually thinking that she's the technical lead for for certain things. But that was the name. I was given like years ago, but then she responds I'm guessing you're not getting the answers you need. So maybe she's not the one who the right technical person.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not understand sure. I mean, oh she's answering that sometimes. I'm not sure like if there should not be a different person like that that owns all the Salesforce stuff. I mean she seems to be like rather jr. Or not. And so I know. You're like who owns all that and then Spain and</div><div><br></div><div>Investigate this Vista the sales team in Spain because they should actually also know and maybe they can send us an overview or presentation or something about the structure.</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, I mean, I will try to figure this out here. I was just wondering if you already have maybe a presentation or something called baseball team structure back in general not just pain.</div><div><br></div><div>In Spain, we try to figure this out. Adjust and get talk is done. And one very quick sing the Spanish total ux design. Should we make this pain now or</div><div><br></div><div>Chris said he'll pick it up but breakfast with basically came back to me and said We got the Trap because I don't think we should be giving it a sequel to this is young but there is different compared to I think the best. The Spanish I take the IT team that they don't do any design. I mean your duty as HTML design or web design. They are pure technical developers basic basically, so they set up databases and all this kind of stuff. So they have actually not so much idea how to design stuff and and the negatives in the past was always me who was doing that I was Excellent drink though. No, no, this is like a separate portal and an agency what's creating that but it didn't end well with the agency so they are no longer contact. So actually the agency would of course do that. But as they no longer have contact with them they cannot do it and now they have no one to else to can program in this sense and they also have no other agency. So it's overly ass or we choose. Someone like an external agency like seeing I was our someone but they have had no contact at the moment. They have no one that they could ask except for us. It's too big. Give me I mean When do they need to make the train from the things that we give me like the day or so Chris is on leave today? I see did they put like the first of February here?</div><div><br></div><div>Let's say two weeks two more weeks and the changes. I think not that big a change, but maybe one day to to program it to to investigate what I have so far and to see what kind of script is needed. I guess one day would be needed to create this element or component that they need. Okay, I would give me okay, so I'm going to take this because I need to pick the correct for somebody today. So I'm going to see if I can see tomorrow. In the meantime. Why don't you just tell her we're going to do it because I don't want it to undermine whatever Christmas to do and maybe just investigate investigate the work required and disability confirm. How many days it needed to make sure it is simple Co my concern is that if we do? Sad development team and I don't think that book for this one, but maybe the understand the situation to have the benefit of eating work. It might change but I don't want to go we'll just get hit with loads more fourth request that they're all I see what they do is we don't do this and I'm more thing come out a way that it has taken responsibility for things that they earn so yes, we can do take care of yourself, but the whole point is where the This marketing we don't own mortal there regardless of the fact that they think that they're more suited to build this databases so that you can build databases. You can add a picture. Yeah. I think that might be able to do the thing. It was never like to develop things. I mean, yeah, there they are. Like, how do you say it like that?</div><div><br></div><div>Babies Her so something like this. So I mean I know what more or less what they are doing. And for example, if there's like started medical search they are making their developing like all these data flow in the background. This is what they do has nothing to do with the design or anything or like developing elements. It's your database programming. Yeah, but these are</div><div><br></div><div>It's like the same girl all the same woman that was writing on basic machine. Basically, we need to find another agency because it didn't end well the need to bring someone else and gold.</div><div><br></div><div>Because she needs to find another agent. Exactly. I mean it's I can definitely talk with them. So for the future that they would need someone I mean could it be us and then for example thinning or sometimes on the time for sensual like how we can use sing in this context or if the Spanish also an external agency and in every Market has an external agency. I'm not sure of this should work. Yeah because they think we've got the language thing.</div><div><br></div><div>A little bit of nothing but deputies but I don't know what that from that portal then I guess he needs someone he needs like the local agency because of the language barrier. Well translator. Yeah so that I did not but it is always language but then also just understanding the home <span>training</span> about how comforting over thing will get active status person. What?</div><div><br></div><div>Which I didn't think it starts up to stall for. I think this is affecting the work peripherally need to just pick yourself with IP like Wendy. And then how do you open conversations? Because this is a problem.</div><div><br></div><div>We consult for we need sot direction from there. But we're being told we don't Deport go and that is how something else we're just repeating what will be no, but we can't solve the problem. And one thing to say, I agree. This is what we'll do. This is what your people do and this is how we support you and will carve out this it team the small things. I haven't had that conversation with the problem while we keep getting all this I'm sick and tired of it to be honest. So I told her that I don't think I just said like my manager if it up with me I'm going to I'm about that investigate what needs to be done with make sure you know exactly the time that require but don't say yes because it might underline whenever crib is planning another problem. I don't know how he is trying to solve this. Okay, so that we are with that one. Anything else? No. Thanks.</div><div><br></div><div>One last thing the whole health and well-being things that the UK. We needed for that that's babies grow up. On</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, stop over 28. The Columbian</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, we're all we will.</div><div><br></div><div>So I know that if she</div><div><br></div><div>Responded, please. I think whatever information he said think about things agree. They of the whole. I don't know. I know we had some dates and fun delivered something for this week and the week after so I don't know if they so need our help.</div><div><br></div><div>Updated on the latest thing. I will double-check that. Yeah. I don't want that to come back on us and that we were going to check that they can upload the Outlook email file, but then I know she wanted to practice downloads of them will wait for the updated research. You should stand I just needed to check for Sean.</div><div><br></div><div>Before I have to track that down load basically, yeah just to check that and that's it. Okay, I think that's everything now.</div><div><br></div><div>Alright guys. Have a good day. You too. Have a good day. Bye.
