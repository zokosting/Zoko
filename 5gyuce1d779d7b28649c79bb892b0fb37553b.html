A lack of labour-force mobility lies at the heart od Denmarks's provincial problem. Then you discover haw young people can't get their apprenticeships and companies can't actually get enough young people to come and work for them.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In Finland, teaching has been as a prestigious career sincethe earliest days, because teachers played a key role in the country's emergence as an independent nation.<u>Finland is a country in which teachers have long been national heroes, at the forefront of defining and disseminating their country's blossoming self-image.</u>They were nothing less than the nation's intellectual freedom fighters.</div><div>They recruited teachers who would be <u>pioneers</u>, to carry the touch out into the country.</div><div>Think back to your own teachers. Exactly. If your experience is of someone who is a nice guy, working well, diligent, trying hard, skilled, you might feel differently.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In funerals, cries of despair are embarrassings. This doesnt' mean the Swedes are unaffected by: rather, they lack the skills to deal with strong feelings and are afraid of doing the wrong thing. <u>This desire to avoid causing friction extends from Swedish corporate world, famously characterised by its consensus culture</u>. Hiring Danes to kick butt is quite common practice in Swedish companies, apparently.</div><div>This sounds like a recipe for procastination and stagnation, doesn't it? So how come Swedish companies have had such huge, global success?</div><div>Because these kind of organisations require large numbers of people to move in the same direction over the long term, they do not tend to benefit from headtrong management.</div><div>In contrast, the Danes excel at small-to-medium-scale businesses which need to be more agile and reactive; apart from a handful of examples, Danish companies struggle to achieve international scale.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><u>By supressing discussion about immigration and not allowing the Sweden Democrats (formerly nazis) their say, the Swedes were making the subect taboo and inadvertently fuelling extremism (Breivik for instance).</u></div><div><u><br></u></div><div><u><br></u></div><div><u>Swedes are not interested in history. <b>Swedes look at their country as modern</b>.</u> They way other countries deal with modernity is fascinating, the argument 'this is modern' is not going to trump everything else the way it does in Sweden. The rest of countries resisted the modernity and have been stuck with a lot of old not very well-functioning, systems.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Culture is not a big thing in Sweden. They are technically creative, not artistically.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The typical Swedish intellectual believes the country is big enough for him to have a career, and not so small that he feels he needs to go outside and bring things in. <b>Its the tragedy of being a mid-sized country.</b> <i>&lt;&gt; el meu pais &eacute;s molt petit</i></div></content></body></html>
