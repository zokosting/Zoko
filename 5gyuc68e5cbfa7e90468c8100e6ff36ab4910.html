Okay good. So yes here. We just had a call with Ezra and team to discuss basically the the the content document requirements that they have and especially review The Domain mapping options so a bit, you know, like I don't First Signal Belgium. I prepared a mapping just for like one page but just for us to be able. Confidence we can use because there are quite different on this website. So I just, you know made an invention reactive of the components that that we have on this website and so they could have this overview as well and I just prepared two options page, you know that we could work with then, you know set up on the the on team site so they had an idea. If you could look like but also, you know based on that they can prepare final. </div><div><br></div><div>Tent that he could have they would really they want to display on this page. I with obviously documents to to Donald foot. So in terms of planning, so they they are preparing now this final content. Dr. The requirements the copy by next week, and we said next Tuesday. </div><div><br></div><div>And then based on this, you know final document we will work on the set up in there in the CMS with with Jose. So I've asked Jason about 30 he replied and we copy the Caesar. He also works on the on this so CMS, and and I practically they said that I mean again, I just wanted to inform them. You know that we are. To work on this. It's a CMS and I want you to know about the you know the structure. And if we have to work on, you know in CC professional or in experience Studio knowing that, you know, I would prefer to send it up in experiment Studio especially because it enables deuterium afterwards to you know, make edits are too so they don't reply that it should be possible to set it up in inexperienced young and May in school. Opponent based so we just need to know to decide which components will be want based on the today's meeting and answer then we should be able to set it up with an experience to you. But but this year we need to review them with Jose. Look at you know, what it looks like when we want to set up a new page see, you know, if all components are available from there. They should be and then start working on the Age early next week, then we would show them what we have done. We know the CMS last review and make last updates and we suggested that the life May 14 which should give us enough time to set up the final page. But I think you have to be careful with the would lead to prepare very good at go. Creep, but you don't have to make sure that what been agreed the what your they can do and make sure they don't mean shit wrong that because I'm very good at saying oh actually want to do this or can we change this otherwise and you have to set the expectations if they want to make changes you first have to obviously is sure that these changes can be made and if I can make it clear that it would add on time to the delivery date because a very tricky trying to get you to do. Can you breathe for the same time for him because we be careful with them about that as well. I'm a stupid good we won't have to work. So I would want to redo my children don't it's like that you're trying to explain everything of doing to I can see your old easy. So what you want to do is every time with any emails back if anything happens you need to be able to leave. And they will get the what you believe they could have one that I'm thinking thinking. </div><div><br></div><div>Kind of need we need me to do I think everything is cool design that you've done and Things Have you talked going to bed and then just make sure that any any calls you're following up on with in writing an email with things you get from that to is doing what and why one and they've all agreed because then you've got that as your backup, okay? And then also in terms of the navigation area, where did you got the junk business six? So it would it would be like a sagging second level navigation page so for page in the navigation service, so That I they are they are looking at it as well because prior yeah, she knows the structure of the website. So they they will look at where exactly want to have it in the second level navigation because it's yeah but members it will probably sit between Solutions and manage my plan. </div><div><br></div><div>Suggestion but I never saw you knows them to look at this as a means of location where exactly are they like to have it and then we will recommend. Yeah is to be like a full page and yeah Solutions in management plan. I fairly but this page. Yeah, we'll need to sit in other sections. So government system. He's individuals. So we will first of course set it up with an employer's and Brokers make sure it's ready final review it with the team. And and once we have the final version, then we will create this same page within the Yeah, the other sections of the website so okay. Yeah. Just want to make sure that we have the latest version before we copy leather, but we will be using components so we'll be we'll be using the same component. So whenever we edit your page, it will be edited anywhere on all on the default pages. So So fine. What you probably would need to do. I know you provided the deadlines that state I will devise that performs of that come up. He just chased them and they came to okay because Port will find as well as that they might in my they end up missing date and then it feeds into everything else. Oh and they're not quite good. It always comes back to you if there's a delayed or something. So you just have to keep chasing them. Okay? Okay. Yeah, right. So then yeah, that's that's it for seeing me. You've seen that we implementation for the you know, the D UTM tagging. So basically we have just updated, you know links within the website. And I and then we published but yeah, it seems that I was not able to publish so tiresome. I helped her. Yeah. Yeah, we could all do with links with the you attend my tags now and I guess you did just need to check that tracking is working properly. Yeah, I could not help but look professional, but we've done our bit. Okay, and then your last update regarding Cigna Belgium so they were Korea is ready. The structure is is ready as well. And I will be working on the page on the interconnection of all the pages based on the last so I had a call with Jason and Mike we will give you this. With my paint mapping just I wanted to make sure you're not forgetting anything. So the development team is also helping to advance this content and basically is preparing the structure and all the components so I can review you know, the the content indexed within it for fun. And so that's quite a with we have a split to do work with this way so we can go we can go faster the better creating actual can play. The pages and then you'll jump in the content and Page component. Yes. Yeah, there are basic. Yeah, the preparing the whole layout the layout and acting H component because they know they know these components and usually it would go faster, but then everyone's the idea is then once you know, each page has the right layout then I check in and add all the venal final coffee and content. So yeah in terms of planning, so we will staging environment by May 8, which means that we want to have all the pages already by this baby State and the launch is planned for May 26.

And so I'm trying to just help them is that but doesn't sound too like two big task. I have to do this and then the stress care.
