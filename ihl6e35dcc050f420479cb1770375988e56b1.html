I don't know.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Hello. Okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay. Oh.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Just a minute.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 11:35</div><div>Like a team or what we do and um, if you get a bit more insight as to where we would fit in these organization, which doesn't seem to be that um that hasn't really been cleared up. It looks like there's still there's still trying to see if he can get um, I guess play stuff really um, because we don't really fit into individual sections on the team that are already established very lucky, but the good news is it's investment. He's actually things were under um under investment in what he thought was avoided the customer. So you see his website as often. Like the way we speak to our customers as we're under invested in that area. So you ideally want to build their area. So it was all positive to be honest. It's just more about when things will happen and they will happen in a time. Um, but I won't use up this call to go through it. I'll go through it and um on our team meeting to get an update and then I'm hoping that I'll get another call in with him. And always also times and I think what I want to do is of the update the team and then like after have another call and just take some questions back to them by then. He also has um, I believe he has some open forums. So I'm just going to get information about those forums from um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Didn't get that information from his PA or other people in his team, basically. Yeah. No, um I I don't know which questions we can make because uh, it seems like we are. Uh a waiting for their decision, so I don't know which Kind of questions we can make just to uh, whoa, wait for the decision to be made. Because all is well. I I've I mean the decision asked me.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Because it's only going to be um. Um you me and my um, so I don't know if we don't need that much time. So it's an update so we can use this half an hour to just go through what the announcements mean. Um, my discussion is so much. Um, basically all type but in terms of our roles, they're very much solidified. Yeah using the only person that actually didn't make any redundancies. Um, and and I raised that as well. So yeah, but we'll go through that in our team meeting. Um, I just wanted to update you and kind of where we are with This project because it's there's no movement really on any of the sides. So last week we all think.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Can't remember if you want to call. So basically, um, nothing's moved much for me. Um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I keep perspective. I'm still waiting on the information I chose. Xena about that. Um, there's quite a lot of information. I'm waiting on but like the guy is just really slow and delivering, um, because we're being chased by cognizant on design. So when they're going to get a designs when they're going to get um, The information that ssw so like to recently a message yesterday, which I'm going to respond to. Um, and also I'm still confused. I don't really feel like we've got clear visibility on what's being delivered. So du is now on the holidays for 2 weeks, so my concern is I don't know if anything's going to move this forward. So sometimes you can ask her. As well&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The message, um when I chase&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Of 4 to say that we were going to they were going to share. Um, I think like 2 Pages designs. Mhm. Um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Hold on. I'm trying to find an email.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So the design set in the purchase is finalizing both the home page. 108 and the share with you 1 of this is done, but she has provided a date. So I think I kind of need your help and I don't know how we get a veiner to support on this or if we just asked Dana for um.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Like the the main contact at our quantity and actually try to build a plan mhm with them if they have 1 already so I think she shared something of more which is very high level. Um, but I think even&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>They are behind. That's from what I've understood. So I just want to get it.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Because I I just I believe she actually just sent it. Direct to me, um, and it's actually included. And that's why I sent it on to you. I think the last time we spoke so.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um, so it was like a high level of plan actually share my screen.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Split across different things so split across every different websites. So this is obviously their plan of what of our quantity just their general service for the different websites. So Um, they're doing SEO for the Middle East which is why it's in here. Um, and then this is what they pulled together high-level for KSA, but obviously this needs to be updated because It's a new template creation. They've also I guess tried to assume. Development somewhere publishing Pages live already. This is this needs to be updated. Um, mhm.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yes, I feel like we need a conversation with them to really get to see website live. Their cognition If we're here, but obviously we need to business. Okay, so obviously they've not we've not got any. Um, Plans development time in here and I think that Africa, um, again, there's new template creation and plan to approval well pages that they're assuming that's really like 10 months time that we would have created these pages.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>And I checked like I this is definitely going to change based on of the ID discussions as well. So I think we need to really try and&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Better stakeholders to get a proper plan in place. So using our housing relief or an added to this is the thing when you use this, that's fine. It's just detailing that but I think that this is not going to work. Um, we need the detail of the case what what the date that we're going to deliver to? Um, Essentially and we need line items for it for Content creation. So basically going back to our template that we use when we do migrations because otherwise we're going to be doing this for ages. So I really need you to um, try and get control over that. Um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>At the moment, you know I had started so I can thing really this hasn't moved. I'm concerned that it was done away until the 17th of April. This is still not going to go anywhere. Yeah, in fact, in fact, we need to understand the zener like 2 support team while she's away and what the plan is that we need to get a detailed plan. I don't mind if they shift but I want the date, but I want to see that each 9 item or the start date is what the end date is and what they're delivering and I think we need to actually have a regular.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I think we need to have more calls with them. So I feel like we need to have 15 minutes stand up twice a week potentially with at least I quality cognizance and the Middle East in order to make sure this move that appropriate speed.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>While we're trying to sort out what's happening with the it part of things and you can bring those people in those calls as and when we need to Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, because at the moment they don't have the liability on. The domain for example or the it side of things like that needs to be built in the plan without properly. Uh, yeah Maria, uh, in fact Cena is uh is emailing me or is writing me and she said that well, she's joining another call. Uh, and so she cannot join today and they have a a public holiday all next week. So well, she she's asking to reschedule this call, uh, Uh, maybe we can arrange a call with them, uh tomorrow.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Or at least with with Cena&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Do you see the yeah, I think she could. Um, just uh, but I guess&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>She can understand where we are. But I think we need to send an email as well. Just to let her know. Um, basically what we're concerned about deliveries is asking or service.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, do you have an update on doing after code case say project? Um, and he needs a few questions answered which I'm going to respond to. Some of the ones I can respond to but a lot of it is relying on literally head it up.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Email&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Questions here. So I think this 1 I have to figure out which is I don't know you can help with this 1 obviously, this is a Question I can answer and share the piss on. This we need an update which we can kind of show where we are. And then this 1.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Which I can go back so I can go back to MRC and just to make sure that you are in. Um. I think we need to get like a regular like 15 minutes stand up as a minimum twice a week just to keep the pressure on otherwise every week. We're going to come to the clause and we're not going to get anything. Cuz the main thing is regardless of what's happening with it cognizant Crystal develop, but obviously we're not beloved to develop to a June date. If we don't have designs it is now April. Yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So tell you uh Agreed the the blockers are for 1 side the IT issues and also the designs, uh that the Middle East needs also to push, uh this um, Because domains and they have been already registered and able to see the the correct who is records. So&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh, the 2 biggest Point actually are the 2 main points at the moment are the well the Middle East needs if I'm not wrong the Middle East need to send us a business, um impact analysis in order, uh to share with it. Right? And and this is something that uh, I'm I'm not sure if it's uh, Zina can advance or can work on this or maybe she needs done also,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh, so Maria, I I didn't hear you. I know I I'm not hearing you. Well, I'm I'm hearing a lot of scratching but uh well&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Well, I think you are saying that she needs de is it she is still needs de for sure. Mhm.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay. Okay, so Uh&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>If if you if you see a Decay I will uh reset you a call with&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Sienna for tomorrow Okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No, I don't hear you.

Yes.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 12:04</div><div>If I do not necessarily for marketing digital marketing, but generally I've got some other catch ups and things I've been most have to say hello to each other.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, I mean, uh.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Manual and&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In Madrid I am Not I'm 2 hours away. So I I can join whenever you are visiting. Um, so yeah, let let us know. Um, we can meet at the office. Of course. Thank you. Thank you.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Hi guys. Sorry I've literally trying to I just wanted to respond to an email that we received last week and I'm really late on responding to it. I just wanted to make sure I got it before I forgot and it's almost a week. Um Everyone had a good Easter break for international holiday break and it's still quite quiet which I quite like this period you can try and catch up with it and stuff and get back to some work work for a work done. Um, that's good to have everyone back 911 leave this week. So there's some items. I'm just trying to pick up with where he's at which might come up here and I know 1 of the comments and guys was just asking, um, you might have a query that we can get to so I'll try to get to this quite quickly. Um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>And Richard, I think I'm just going to look for a time for us to catch up because I did have an initial 30 minutes estimate from us yesterday, which is quite casual. Um But I just wanted to I just have a catch up with you and just give you a view of what um.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>He said if you didn't really say much, but I think you just need to announce that the house is not worked and um probably that has to be engaged with him more than anything and what I need to prepare for. Um, Ask questions when actually come up now, but we're officially in the Keystone. I'll try to see if I can find time tomorrow, but it might end up being next week. Okay. Yeah, that's great.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Well done. Um, I'll try and get through this so quickly. I feel like we're still stuck in the same place on this and this is 1 of the items with some ashes like telling me he is there to help. I just don't know what that means in reality. But things like this, um, so So this is this is the ioh publishing. I guess that's going to help benefits. So I had a catch I had an introduction about sort of the initial like initial call with zip that but all we want to do is change 2 files and ask them all manner of stuff. So you need to provide all the details of of what I said. Yeah. I've done that. Here's the diagram. So I was on the call with Paul Williamson and someone from the TSC intake team. I'll check before because I think I said, well, I think I'll provide everything that I need. Can you just go and they wanted to do some due diligence checks to see else if anyone else where he uses this same publishing and I said, well gee it's probably a good reference. Point so uh, I don't have any update but we're slowly making progress. This is not the technical installation because we can only do that. This is allowing us to let the 2 parts of the system talk to each other.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, and that's fine. When was that all because again, I think I'm trying to compile a lot of this stuff where we're kind of blocked and if he can help remove the blockers. I don't know if you can but sure it was I'm just checking. I think it was last week towards the end of the week.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I'll send you the details. I tried to look for what it was on if I was Wednesday or Thursday.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh, here we go.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>With the guy called Debbie.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That's a 2028 wasn't it? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, it's a lady. Sorry.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I mean our progress in mine.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>You're comparing yourself against but yes, it's definitely progress not quite as quick as I hoped for but yes. We're slowly chipping away. And I guess uh, yeah, I mean if we got the year of Smash now and say look what we want is some guys say yes, because we want to push by definition marketing content on a marketing site. Can you help us get that through the system and let's see what we can do. We'll have that capture. It seems inappropriate to pull. Pull So actually with is a hot 1 about firewall, but let's talk about it.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, exactly. That's why I just want to check with you like you know what to do. I mean he just lays back in but yeah, we'll pick it up from where but I just want to flag it while I have this direct report in line into him. Obviously that's not going to be there for long. Um, so I just thought we what we can leverage what we can. Sure.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Can I help with some items? Cool. Um, okay brand campaign. My name is pretty much caught up in that everyone's. Yeah, basically Gone live, right? Yeah. So, uh, the Singapore side was redirected last, uh, Last week last Thursday, so I guess yeah, well this is now live. And we can remove this from the list.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh awesome. And yeah, I thought what we can do. Um when you get a chance is probably we add in a separate line. That's almost like a safe to I guess if there's anything that's required. Um, if it's just being us updates that we can do you can just add it in in here on this table and that's something and just mark it there's something that we can basically pick up on ya thing. Yeah. I'm picking up the the like, you know, simple content updates for better event updates and these are quite quite simple. But yeah, if something comes up like a new article or things like Daniel the new CMS Item and um On yeah for development. I guess I will need to ask something for Middle East right when we started. Yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, that's fine. Whatever and also, um I really just come back this week. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That's actually but we received all the make contact with it doesn't need to work on for the next lot of UK content updates removal.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh, yeah, but we are regarding UK, uh changes. I'm currently working on these this week and we're all changes are finished. Uh planet next week. I will send uh to test environment. Uh, let the team know let Gail know. Um, well I saw there were some uh updates regarding provider section and content for that gave us for a review on this and well, he's requiring some changes in the documentation, but it's okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, I'm going to provide a section. Yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, that's fine. Um, if you need any support on this stuff, let me know if I think you've got it pretty much. Handled at the moment if we need The the call a regular call with scale and while Virginia is on leave we can we can put that in place as well. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That's fine. I'm just going to skip down to.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>These 2 items. So here is um, I've just sent an email, um asking some of the questions you had about I'll put you there for on the call because 1 of them Richard. I just asked I don't know if you know anything about where we can assist those few questions. About the case in actual project 1 of them that I suppose. My team related is asking if he had like a an international GitHub repository. So I know Enterprise has 1 I don't know if we left that off. We have 1 but IH and I'm not even sure so I've already yeah Harish and I talked about that. So we've already done an intake for that that goes through. Uh, we use Azure devops or Ada and that's where you have the Google git repo and so I've worked I did an intake to that IH devops team. I think it's Carlos. Someone and Marco spagnoli that picked up that request and then provided me through the process so we were not done yet, but I'm hoping by the end of next week. We'll have a um a be able to version control and it doesn't have to be Source, but if you wanted to Version Control that thing then we can check in check out and Vision Revision history and those kind of things so work in progress and reach and I already had some conversations about that. Um Separated thanks for helping on that. Um, oh and any other questions that I can answer that I just um sent email on Harish. So I've shared so done your raise the PIP before she went on leave. I shared those gifts. However, I was um, I have to reiterate and I'll just share them. So I don't know if the resident information that I offered to provide is&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Anytime manager&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>When I came back on that detail because it wasn't shared. So I'm going to chase her again to see if she can provide it. So that's just a detail. You normally need for the smw. So on your way to separate test. So we are having 2 separate W's I hope you should raise them combined but I think because we provided this extra separately she done that separately so I kind of turned the time. Raising the trip and going for the SMB process. Um, so yeah, but don't think you're struggling to get support. From 131 not being on the dough stick. This might be a slow 1 but I think what I'll do is um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>This going to come back before the end of the day. She doesn't I'll just send in another email, but I'll include you guys in do as well. Um, because I'm also a bit concerned that next week. I think I think Ramadan is coming up and they're going to be on lead to the whole week. Um, so that's going to be another week out.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um on that in terms of design Again, I chose that as the performance of an email and I checked it twice last week, um how they trying to get together de and I can't seem to get a proper project plan as we normally have migrations because I think we've been missing this um, and it seems to be a struggle to pull this together for all the different streams. So being being tasked, This week to see if there's something you can do directly by quantity as much as possible at least on design and you guys on the benefit side while we're trying to work out the items that have lots at the moment. Um, For for the project Um, so we're hoping to just get a bit more rigor in terms of standards for that. So at the moment they've not shared anything she just mentioned, um in the email that they are going to they're working on 2nd and just see if we can speak directly to my quantity to get a confirmation of when we get to each template design date. So at least review, um, so obviously would have be confirmed but I think if you've got a first eye on it, it gives us an idea in terms of what we're creating if you already have some of those components, um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 12:17</div><div>Conversations on design anyway because your team has to approve what bright quantity deliver so as soon as&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>We're going to try and get a date and I'll share the state commitments with you in advance while we're trying to pull a proper plan together in parallel. So hopefully that answers any questions, but I have raised that I think the the development date is going to have to Go like this actually going to have to shift anyway, but I think development is going to have to shift because we don't have anything. Um, and it's 8 April so But she's just talking about delivering home pages and then seeing if she was thinking this will be done by the time she goes back from leave on a 17th then hopefully from that. I feel like we probably struggle to hit a New end of the June delivery date and I just want to set that expectation. So if we do hit it, it's fine. But if you don't if you're aware of it, and they had spent their impact on that as well. Um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That's really to to make you aware of that. And if you got any more questions on that hero sure hope that is your summary, but you've got it in writing as well.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Definitely and most of my questions are answered. Uh, and once you get more information now, you can chat with us also, uh, if there is any uh meetings which are happening, uh, you can look me in so that uh, we are all&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>All the same page&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, so we'll we'll organize that at the moment. We're trying to get the meetings directly by 20 just to keep the momentum because I'm a bit worried that at the moment the we can usually have them done. Yeah. Nothing really seems to progress. I think we need to get the stakeholders on the call. Um, so yeah, as soon as we arrange that we'll what can that time and again, I'll just be 15 minutes just to Leave and follow what the pastor and that should get some. States in um, yeah, we'll update you on those. Um call I'm just going to skip because obviously as soon as it says dress code Richard, I think I said this in multiple times. Um, I need to transfer an email out to you just to help with the redirect tickets for the other like um, because I think that we've got a lot in there either. Okay. I think we fixed the gih just the other 1. Yeah G2 just the yeah, I know was the primary 1 so that's Fine, but&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Add in here, I don't know if I did.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No, that was basically about it's another project that was quite old like another brand project, but they also want to be commissioned in so I'm wondering if we can just&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Sorrows together. Um, so her age I I'll add it in here as a line item, but I'll just need the URL for that the online Wellness tool Um that some of the apis were not working in the lower environment. So it's the same actually, uh, I can work on the commissioning in the lower environment. Uh, and I can let you know so that I can uh validate the changes in the lower end regarding the redirects. I think we need to uh, uh work with uh, someone from the ID. Uh, since it is DH know, I think I can follow up with with This 1&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, so yeah, so I was hoping we can combine. I don't know if we can which is but again, that's something we can pick up on the call. But yeah, um, basically they don't really want to go ahead and do those sort of things to just get updates. So if they can decommission, um, which I think would be a preference anyway to get rid of Pages and then I'll be using um, so I'll send them each separate email about that not add it in here as a line item. Okay, if it's a if it's what's called a subfolder, so if it's <a href="http://www.site.com">link</a> and 23, you still need a certificate, but if it's a different domain such as stress wave dot signal <a href="http://health.com">health.com</a> or whatever then you're right if we don't need that whole URL then that's something we can let the certificates expire but just to call that. Yeah, if it's if it's The same domain that we still need a certificate. Yeah, I'll double check what the issue is, um what they needed a certificate for because I don't think it was the main related and I could be actually talking about completely the wrong thing because at the moment, um, so I'll double check what it was but it seems that if they could just decommission it wasn't going to be something that they'd have to do. In essence for Just double check what the request was from pizza and go from there. But thanks for calling out. Um I just want to talk to you about in mind as well. Um.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Well, then I'm actually going to take these off because with all the changes that's happened. I don't think this is going to end up being something they're going to Move forward with and now all the markets are effectively. Changed but I'm actually just going to yeah, sure. I mean the the quiz is is live. Anyway, this is the you know, the the changes we had deployed for this project initially. This is still you know live so people can still access the quiz. Uh, if Uh if they want to but uh, yeah any changes moving forward? I don't know if yeah, we'll make any any&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh, um if I can just because I don't have much time and I feel like we're pretty much up to date with it. Just like I just want to quickly skip to the SEO items and we can go back to HSI because Can't remember who it was for certain email. Other questions&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So harsh I can't remember who it was but send an email to manual while he was on on leave on leave. There are around 12 items. So the item number 1 2 uh 4 5 6 are not 4 5 6. 1 uh 4 5 6 are already being completed 2 and 3, uh recently we made some change and there are some queries, uh on item number 2 and 3.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That was green and raised those uh questions.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, sure.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Let me know in the&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 12:24</div><div>Okay, that's fine. I think the main thing here as long as the URL to a muting a site map. That's fine because obviously the the technician exist anyway, because it'll just go to redirect to Pace I think as long as that URL to the site map. Um, if I keep the actual index Pages sold in the back end then that's fine. Um, I don't think that's an issue if you're on this.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No, are you sure there's the only thing we didn't remove?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay. Okay. So do you just need us to double check? Um, I guess the items and data that you sent you just need just to double check that in the other environment or um or just double check because it's live already. Well, yeah, actually, uh, the changes are already live, uh, you know, right, uh, when someone publishes the pages the site map gets deployed along with it. So anyway, this is whatever we've made know, it's already live now. So the uh Team can directly check in the live event on&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, great. I'll let the agency know as well. So I'll check the parallels. I let the agency know so they can check all those items. Um, is it attached if that if it's attached to the meeting before?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 12:27</div><div>Estimate for these items you can complete all these later.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I have a quick.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>What we are. At the moment, but I guess&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Years&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I feel like&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>A hosting service&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That's where&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>What that means?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, I guess.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Like&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>My&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Is&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Sorry.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Delivery&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>You said before it's it's good.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>It's good to have this and there. So, uh Yeah, looks like it's getting good so back.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 12:41</div><div>Uh for now make it a um, like a basically just that information website in a building to the job site. So we want to use existing platforms and not like for listing on the same website. So I think maybe you did question the fact that like whether we need to have a job listing or not on the website. Um, so that probably is the main reason and then I guess If he is in the call, it would be for like a demo. Oh, sorry, I have to go in and look. Sorry. I'll be back.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>All right, once you do that, okay. Um, can you hear me? Occasionally? Yeah. Yeah, actually I'm I'm here you are currently Yeah, well, okay cool. Um so I can try to quickly go through what I've seen in the other call. So um in the call we have tomorrow the same now, I've just seen she spent um the update to information like after 4, or she sent an email so it's going to check it everything. Um, but in the call tomorrow the 2 things to go through was obviously you mentioned the impact analysis. Um, I'll check what she sent through because then we can take that SEO big detail often. It's for now, um, but if not, then we can have that on there in terms of whatever's missing.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>And then the other thing that we need is um to discuss is basically obviously while Um don't want to leave if everybody that we can speak to while the um a way obviously if it's like a national holiday for the whole week because it's Ramadan that's going to impact our quantity and that total is going to be at a standstill um until then, but it would be quite good to Have someone so we're not waiting for 2 weeks, right and for um someone to come back and spoke because then it's not back into the 17th of April. Um, and I think I think we need to try and keep it moving so that those are the key things that means trying to get from Xena as well. As you know ra that we need to get a stand up call in place with the key stakeholders, um, just to keep and let them go because it's stagnated and we need to have a proper plan. In place, which is also why we want to speak to our quantity and have that contact so you can work with them. To build out like the separate streams and you know have a list of all all those tasks to be in that stream so that when they're doing a stand up call we can go through. Okay what we're going to focus on this week.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>But an external call what we going to get done and then if we missed that then we can go back and say okay 1 is it going to get done? So it just has that scrum? Um focus on this project and then I also just want to raise the concerns around. Being able to deliver for end of June, um without having designs. For for the next about April, um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So yeah, and obviously her is just mentioned on the call, you know is he has visibility of what the new components are that's something they can at least start work on because if anything's an existing that's I guess less work to copy over anything.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay. So, uh, should we continue pushing uh for the Africa content or design collaboration? No matter of the it, uh, Well it aspects.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>As a parallel so cognizant can be developed if they have designs. So the sooner we get designed to fill a cognitive start their work and then it's just a case of trying to get it. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>String on block so when it comes to go live all the infrastructure is already there. So cognizant made it clear. They can continue developing. Obviously. We just won't be able to push anything to any um environments because we don't have them. Okay? Yeah. Okay. So at least at that point at least if we've done we don't want to be held up by infrastructure. So if we've done our bit, then it's just a case of waiting for it so we can connect the dots. So they're not then starting development depending on when they're able to support us because there's a more work that needs to be done than initially anticipated because of the site being in an old server. So they said that we have to build this site on new infrastructure. Um, but the question is, you know, when can they stand that up?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Technically, but you just trying to help us. Help guide us through Um, and they're waiting on I guess updates from last but they need the impact analysis from us so we can share um, and then they will 1 of the idea of you know, if they split, you know, you know, is that Could they a hard deadline know but that pays a 1 is but I don't really want to tell it that. Yeah, because in other words they'll just Be prioritizing everything and 1 we need to push it out. So.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Mhm. Okay, that's it with with that. Yeah. I just wanted to make sure obviously you can hear me last time. Um, but while I was back, so I'll just step back. Um, a lot of the all the announcements just come out the hoses just come back and obviously seeing all the different announcements. So it's quite a big structural change across all of marketing. So in essence, There is no longer essential marketing team lots of IHL marketing teams. Um, they've split those teams up. I guess you won't get kept into a different business unit. So each market, so ioh,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Jhp and JH or have their own assigned marketing teams within the business.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Unit, um, and obviously These tools were split as part of that in a really strange way. So luckily for us as Theory. We've been moved over into some issues IHS. But I can't remember what it that's what international Health delivery service or digital service. Um, so he owns everything digital to an extent. It doesn't include um PCC. Um, and he's obviously just poking on. At the end just because it came with me. I don't know if it was still fit with me and we didn't really get that far in the call yesterday the call yesterday was quite a casual. Getting to know you conversation and a high level like quick round up of You know what the team?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Does um where we have some struggles that what his leadership style is like so it was really um quite a high level. What was very clear, but I did ask the question on I said that Obviously was movement is business unit, but it's not very clear from the um, Announcement where we sit so I it had explained where I assumed we would sit because I've seen that we would have been collecting the Sierra and we would have reported it to Frank or Terry, but in fact the world which obviously isn't the case we've kind of been separated. So at the moment I'm reporting it to semester and the interim but he's going to have potentially what he did say was that he is looking at but nothing this is confidential because nothing's actually decided or concerned so that what it's going to look like but he is essentially looking at um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For him websites didn't fit in any of the existing. Um Department that he has so we were basically almost were technical but um, We're not we're not operations. So the technical but on our technical enough to be part of the applications or po world where they deal with obviously portals. Um, the way he saw it is that the website is um, How we speak to our customers? So he thought that we're under investors in um resource and um a department that supports voice of the customer. So he ideally what he sees in the future is he would like to have a head of customer experience?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Need that would be his SLT. So that person was important to him. So I guess that would almost be like our new Chris, um in essence. And I would report into that person that person with a negative being an expert on this on the website. We will still do the experts. So that person has a wider remit of the customer experience across everything so not just websites but portals all out all touch points where we speak in his word to the customer. Um, but however This Confidential because That's the part when he wants to build. So actually he wants to invest in that and build which is why he didn't Cut Resources Coastal we're very underinvested and and under each like in that area. Um, so the way he would see it working is almost you have like a agile scrum team. So we would I guess start to follow the agile process and it is almost like team of Consultants. So when there's a specific project we will be pulled in with other people. I guess kind of like what we do. And where we're now and we just don't do it very properly. Um, so where they need someone from web starts from us from from yeah from it. We will be pulled into support and that specific project. And once that project is complete where the standard will go back to our different teams basically, so that's almost the process. He sees happening with the the Departments and where we would sit but we're almost like a new we'd be a new area. Um, He's kind of asked me of the he also asked me. You know, how I felt about the changes how the team feels about the changes. Um, I feel like having that conversation maybe for a lot more secure in terms of okay. Yeah. He was saying that he wants to build. A resources like I've got no concerns about our roles. Um, which is the main thing obviously I wanted to clarify on um, and then um, also I guess&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>You know conventions, you know us being pulled into this area. Is the hope that where we have had challenges and an IT perspective we are closer to those teams. So where he can be our direct Champion to help. I guess what he can if you get caught and regret how we can help remove that naturally this process to follow, um, but his job and and what he said was clear his leadership style is either necessary in the um, Even the business of telling so he's in the first year he gets to do a lot of canning a lot of directing because they have to create foundation and now they've done that he's taking a step back and he sees his job very much as he's an expert at any of these 2 areas. So he doesn't seem to love the expert. He sees themselves as a person that can help remove the blockers where possible that would be experts. So the way we utilize him or work with him is like if we're really stuck with something and followed every channel. Um, and I'm not sure where we you know, how we can move around things. That's what we can raise with him. So I think he has quite regular forums. So he said that you know, I'm more than welcome to join those. Um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 12:53</div><div>So there was no information about how we get access to those of what those look like or how we host them. But um, my thing is he reads all his emails which is a different from Chris. So that's very helpful. So, you know exactly what we're working on and what's being done. He knows exactly what's happening in terms of the Rebrand discussions. So that's quite nice and I'm not sure how much he needs. Um, and he kind of explained that which I'll go into in a bit. But um, yeah, it's very much how we can use it. We need to like, you know, no question is a silly question, but I feel quite confident because I feel that I think before I felt that we lost a champion in Chris, but I think we've gained the more influential 1 moving into so much as well. He has the ear of Jason very closely. Um, and I thought that we would see if it will take a while because there's a signal but I thought that we should only see Positive Growth within his world. And I think the things we're going to get to tap into is you know coming down to individuals. So, you know, um, but what I did say to him is I wanted to give the update to the team first and then any questions we can I can play and then let's see if I can get another session with him and just you know on things that we're thinking about. Um, but I would I thought a bit more confident.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um, so I think I think before I felt like we've lost. Like Someone influential or we don't have that but I think this gave someone that as um, Has a lot stronger influence. So I only see it as a positive. I think I've mentioned in my last call with him. It might be tricky. You might not have defined questions because there isn't really anything for 5. So at the moment this head of customer experience person. It's not even approved. So it's it's not even really a conversation at this point. Um, it's something he has to pull together something hesitates aboard to approve they might say no because obviously it's a it's an extra cost. Um, Potentially, but he did say that he would need that person for time. I did have an inkling that that was going to happen anyway, because Ruth had mentioned something before when he I had my last 1 to 1 with him and he was um leaning in and he even mentioned that um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>They were looking at having that area and they were considering lean as a potential strong candidate and he confirmed that on the call where she will be 1 of the people, but obviously I guess not the person but she's a strong candidate and I think&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Sea of the naturally because she owns ux like of this customer experience. Sorry customer experience for Envoy. Um, she's probably proved herself in that area. So it would make more sense for her to transition into Rob. However, it wouldn't be something she can do part-time. So, um, You know at the moment she's customer experience head of customer experience, but also Achieve marketing officer for a market. Yeah, it can't be done on a part-time. You have to be a full-time resource. So that quite confidential so please don't share that clean. You made it very clear it could potential but he said that he felt that we should know because obviously the impact of directly and I should relay this to the team but make it clear it's confidential because obviously it hasn't been approved. So we might not even happen. Um and lean isn't aware of this either so she might not even be the person because obviously she was maybe extended here considering but it could be Open um as well, so it might not you know be.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh, it could end up being someone external that they run out the role externally can be someone else completely but so she's not even aware that they're discussing this. Uh, she's probably got an inkling. It's probably come up a few times but it's nothing's confirmed. But that's essentially what the structure was potentially looked like so we would basically be a new Department in his world. Okay, great. So I'm just going to pause there for a second before I go into other things we discussed. I mean to be honest like a lot of the the beginning part. He was asking me he wanted to know me personally and then like obviously a bit more about like what what I've done what the team do I didn't get to go into the detail of it. So, I think it'd be quite good to for me to set up another call to just go through. Okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>More detail in terms of what we're currently well. I think it's good for any of that. Like what we're currently working on. It was very much a casual conversation. But I imagine that will start having calls will be given overview of what you're working on how you currently structures who does wanting a team, um, in essence. Um, I think it's our customers around CSI, um in particularly the project they're not just a project the Bangalore team that he's building their like what that resources for how we leverage that how we work with cognizant is that they're going to be impacted by that going to change I didn't get to go through Any of that? Really? I thought that call was a bit too soon to go to those specific questions. I feel like on the next few calls. I can go into those questions in or go into those in a bit more detail and raise any questions in relation to that. I think what you've seen on is, you know, he was trying to understand how the team feels and also naturally I said, well they the uncertain so I think knowing what the changes kind of creates some of the uncertainty but then I'm hoping that when I speak to you guys about what we've just discussed about our teams.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Rolling where we set that would eradicate the rest of the uncertainty as much as possible. Even the fact that&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The stuff we just don't. Necessarily know yeah. Yeah exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I guess the the main thing I guess yeah is is really understanding, you know, like what are the impacts for us and and like you you said, um, if it doesn't change most of what we're doing then it's uh, mainly understanding. What is the new organization how we are going to work? And if there is this new Department then what does it mean for us and how we work within this department? And well, yeah, I mean a lot of questions also would come up if when we know um, if that is confirmed, right?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, if you just follow that as well what he did say to me is to start thinking about so I think what clothes we can influence that so what he did say to me is that we kind of do it back and it's to start thinking about you know, If you could do it through scratch, like what would that structure look like what the website looked like as well? So he's in the business of doing things properly, but he understands that there is some kind of the challenge of having to deliver.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Because that they need to do things now and it's hard to do that but he's not in the business of constantly doing short-term fixes that never actually eradicate the problem which is why the discussion on Rebrand consolidation and website so she came up collectively because obviously we've been doing things added now doesn't nothing in its the correct. Way, which is what he said that the business case is that it's options. We can put down in front of the board to say.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>These are options. This is a decision and maybe we end up in throwaway work because that's what they want to do because we don't want to spend any more but then we can still have a future outlook of how these things properly. Yeah, it's very it's very good opportunity for us. Like if it trusts us to uh, I mean the influence how this would uh be cut structured and how we would work like if we get like improvements or so compared to how we work now. I mean, that's that's that's good for us, right? But yeah, we don't know if that would that would be 100% as we want. But at least we can treat it.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I mean, yeah, we can like uh, um. Edit how you call it? Um, like clearly right? Like how what type of structure we ideally would like know. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah, totally. Yeah, that's a an option. And so again, I think it's just getting more clarity from him on you know, exactly what everything is looking for. Does that mean, you know structure it was quite a wide conversation. So I kind of thought of like if a structure in terms of How that department is and operates what in terms of how we do things with our websites. You know, what we could do how we can clean things up. Um, how we should be working how we should be part of agile as well. Yeah. Actually we are working this like what you said, I guess it it would help to probably improve how we work right? But if if we do it like fully fully agile would would it be like A um And how we can get a support easily from Auntie from ux from I don't know the other teams. Um, yeah and Maria are there anything we can do in the meantime of this? Uh, Discussions are made are there anything we can do, uh, like uh, for example work more closely to uh, something or to focus on a kind of projects or to work on. Uh, I don't know.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Expand our Communications What do you think?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Well, I need to discuss it. So it was just getting a corporate Association and quick. I feel like there'll be more conversations that would bring a bit more clarity to what it is and we're looking for. Um, I think there is like research work that could be done in terms of understanding like in&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>How like teams are structured in other organizations again? I don't know if you messing with my input on that, but I feel like an opportunity to to give it with this like idea of this kind of customers experience role. Um, and then also from&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>A website perspective again&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>What should that look like with a consolidation discussion? I think I think that's something that's definitely the right thing to do. Um And I think it's just looking at okay, what what are the things that you can start from scratch? What are the things we would change so that platform, you know would be really focused on consolidating further. So it's like&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Not multiple websites, you know, it's like 1 website across the whole of I8. Is that something you would consider? Um, does it make sense?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 13:05</div><div>At this stage, but you never know what will happen in the future. I think for now for certain there needs to be 1 Global site that covers GHP IO and GH and then I think for the markets like the Middle East. Um, Singapore China That's so regionalized. It has to be separate because their requirements have been completely different their language requirements. Are completely different. I think it's more about how we ensure you know, Google is&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ranking and presenting the right website to the right region. So there isn't cross-contamination on certain terms or keywords or languages as the countries. I think that's the thing. I didn't get questions around the main strategy. I bring that back up as well, um to a few what we have. But yeah, I think there's a lot of re initial research to do but I think not Spoken to me about 100% Um, especially because of the speed I already have your project especially because in the stuff that's coming in thick and fast and like cases quite high priority projects. I mean we can't&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>From that we have to really learn that in and get Public trans not in place and deadlines Are going to address asap, uh, because we cannot miss definitely. Okay, so we cannot miss that best of December or end of November deadline like that is not a definite negotiable. So again, that would I just work from those for now and I think as I have as we have more conversations with The match. Um, I think find out a bit more about the forums that you can join. You can find out something that we can we can all join the forums. If it if it's just I was doing a forum. I don't know how people work. And so I'm hoping to get speak more about them or Someone else. Um, you can provide a bit more information about how But his leadership style essentially, um while I'm talking to attorney in the interim and then and then I can come back to you guys with okay, right? I think we can start looking at this but if you see things about You know website strategies in 2024. Um, yeah, and again like SEO strategies that we need to consider and how that's considered into website builds for 2024 because again, I'm not 100% sure on the 1st of advice I have for him which I did raise that SEO what what would be doing with that SEO but I think it's going to detail on that fully. I kind of concentrated on the work we're doing for GH. Um, so if you questions I have around, you know, Priority forecast, um now with the new structure, um, how we've worked in the past. Obviously. I'm a female marketing Services just expanded. So we're going to end up doing&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>A like I guess all the work again like before so having to support. Let's see how much changes um.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Which I don't know. I I think in this point, I don't think it's a bad thing that comes that comes back into us. I guess it's just making sure that again we prioritize that so that we just have&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 13:08</div><div>Yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Didn't get to go through that stuff with him. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah now which which makes sense. I mean there's a lot of topics to be discussed. Right? Uh, so just like starting to have conversations with with him. I mean, it's totally totally normal, but it it's I mean, it's good to know that he has a um, I guess like a looks like a good leadership attitude and uh, and he would uh rely on us also to To I don't know influence how things could be could be done. I think I mean he seems to be quite open. Um, so um, so it's a good good sign. No, it's good for us.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, exactly.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Exactly exactly is um a a good time by 100% I&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um start to like Yeah, I mean, my perfect would be probably to report.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Internet for a longer period of time but we'll just see what the future hold. I mean I'm not I don't definitely want to take on like a head of customer experience.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Because I feel like that's quite widely reaching. Um. And that would require. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, I wouldn't say it could be that and the website. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, you wouldn't want to call me away from websites because they're just like obviously no 1 to lead on it per se with their history. So I saw that. Yeah, it's not I mean I had a couple of friends not necessarily. Kind of like 1 to go down to the correct perspective, but definitely prefer. The more digital route. So I feel like there's there's more tangible tangible results, especially on the business side of SEO and seeing how it impacts Revenue. But um, I think it depends if you know what this world would look like, um, In essence what it would cover if it if it covered like portals and things like that. Um, I think it was at a different company and yeah, but actually now And the way it works, I don't think I really want to touch portals at all. Yeah. Yeah, and they are all being managed by other other. Yeah, but you have to travel like it will be changed and like sometimes speak in terms of quite painful for but then I guess um, nothing's changed. So I think it's more about what's this space?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>See&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, understand. Um. And I was just wondering like um you uh, where you at fit like they already belong to a department right? Because I mean the customer experience is quite close to user experience. So,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Also this good. Um be like that's kind of the connection, right, but they are already part of a different team, right?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, they are. So, um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I think that will stay that way.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>And and it's not just what they do, right and they they do all different, but it's not just For a external Port tools or it's it's a bit. It's a bit everything right in terms of ux. So yeah. Yeah exactly.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, exactly. So I guess that's why the way you see it is like we're all Consultants on those different projects that if the project is a portal people everybody from all the different teams that are relevant to that project so you cuz customer experience is different from ux because ux is on the user Journey on the actual application itself or a couple of experiences looking at A bigger picture of all the different touch points and how they come into us. What does that gem look like from the first touch point of my phone? It can be by website. It can be by like mobile phone. Like what does that look like all the way through the Journey and what they become a customer all the way up the back end as well. Um where the ux looks at the user design. Um, yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay. Yeah. No, it's very different then. Yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay. Um, so we are looking forward to know. Oh, sorry, I can see no just just a reflection who is in uh, let's say charge on cognizant. I mean is cognizant, uh plan or Are they working with another departments actually? Because I'm and and and thinking that they they need to lay eyes with a lot of it and I love a lot a lot of ux departments. Um What are the plans for them?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I don't know. Um, I don't know what the terms are to be on there. So I don't have answer for you on that 1 yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No, and I don't know how much he's aware of what we do. Um, I know he had the few conversations with them their part. I don't have details in.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um in that sense But I do actually yeah, I'm not sure and they actually uh resided in records. For from another departments&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Or or I don't I don't know. Um I'm not sure. They get confidence like quite big organizations with different teams that work across the street there. Um, so let me give you referring to our teams to looking for the answer to that. I don't think so, but I'm not sure.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, okay. Okay. I just I was thinking out loud. Sorry.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No, yeah. No. Yeah. I don't have an answer to that and I don't know how much.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>If that will change or not, but it's quite a big organization. It's quite a few. Um, Um get working different teams across signal. Um We've got Enterprise and Enterprise. Um wide organization that we work with on digital service policies and as well. Yeah, but yeah, they think there's any chance to change anything at the moment, but I don't know. Okay, okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Well, um, are there any other questions?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh, that's the moment. No.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Awesome. Um, is there anything we don't have much time? I just I just want to focus on that to be honest. But is there any thing in particular um that you guys need to call out and need not support on or um, I think while there we've kind of solved the issues for&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>It in terms of where we're building it. Yeah. Yeah, we did we did and thanks for that. So we are building the the website and we'll do as much as possible before you know end of next week. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Also, yeah, we finishing components updates. Uh, so nice looking good. I can I I can see it and I'm also supporting the team on website creation. So it goes a bit faster on, you know content to put in all that stuff. Um Yeah, I think yeah, let me know if you need any if you need extra hands on that. I know I'm a bit Rusty because I've done content with them my part but if you need to handle that I'm going to have you to um help. Um, if you need quickly, um, what I'm doing is just some initiating the creation and then I bring it in recognition.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Team members when I need them, you know to kind of sort out things or help me upload the content or help me fixing components. So I kind of like, you know initiate the layout so I can progress on that and see what it looks like and then when I I get stuck I bring them in so they can continue focusing on the sum of the component HTML dates and all of that and then in addition to that it will support us. So I mean, you know, the the the part of the project anyway, it's just that I I want to get ahead of it. But yeah, where is our call, you know, if if I need help. Um And yeah remaining question from me was about this meeting that I would like to set up with so much. Um, and I got information from gitika that she's gonna be on leave from the 13th to the 23rd of May. So this leaves us, um, if we want to have this meeting, uh first, uh, first half of May it will be around the uh, 9 or 10 of May and I wanted to ask you whether you think that it's a good time whether you would give a call. Um, I can just suggest it and reply, you know by email and send it to her.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, so if you can do um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh, I don't know if you don't mind that little piece up and out of the&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Movement Um, yeah make it the knife of legs. I'm going to be on a half day on well on the 9th of May at 12:00 UK time. So if it can be in the morning, um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That's probably like the ethical core. We're going to change that anyway, but I probably won't join so I can do. Basically 9 to To like Well, but for every 9 to 11, um on the night of late, but Friday will probably be be better. It's quite open at the moment. I've got 1 call in the morning on Friday, but I can always rearrange that so I can always try and move that to another day. So Friday, so it would be better to for for us, I guess because it it&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>You know Day to you know, make sure we've got a staging site, um up and running and everything before the meeting. And I would be back on the&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So yeah. Oh, okay. So maybe on the 10th, um and&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um, well 1 if we can get the call in from like 9:30 UK time just because I got the voice off. Um Friday, so just give me more time to get back to home in case any issues like so at the moment. Um Know what she was saying when I dropped them. Um and then like 1 of those being a bit clingy when I leave. So I always have to spend a bit longer convincing you to get back into line and go in for I don't want to join it late so it can be from like 9:30 onwards and I can rearrange that um, Okay, okay. Okay. I'm not sure who's going to set this up. I think kishka will but uh as soon as this uh to her and also double check I need yeah, I'll check that. Jerry is available at uh during this time and then my calendar now so I can quickly. Oh, yeah Monday 2&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um, yeah. Well, it's the only option then we enter it's it's going to be 10 with me and hopefully so much. Thank you.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um clearly&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um, so at the moment actually This is where you're basically you blocked after until.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>33 between 83 between 9 and 10:30, so just drop in a message and um, who else did you want to see? I guess it's like who else is also available, isn't it? So Yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For the website discussion. So basically put in 930. I think we just need what half like 45 minutes. Um, yeah, so maybe 1 Or 4. Yeah, I mean so that's like 4 something 4 to 5 minutes to an hour. That's fine. But um I think we tried to go through. Um. I think it's kind of structured for it. I mean, uh, um, actually put an hour put an hour and we just see that's fine. Yeah. Yeah, so just send an email to tierry myself. Um, just say that&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>This is basically the time the date that they're looking at that for their time.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, I was gonna double check with you before before sending the I think I'll just uh&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Reply and we throw it needs to be that call. So I'll just use the same group, uh from the stand ups and I'll double check the yeah this date and time with everyone and then I guess&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No problem.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ahir: 13:26</div><div>Um, cool. Yeah. That was the only&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Heard and the rest I think. Sorted out. Yeah, the the main issue. Um now we just need to yeah to you know, continue the Uh the website build and hopefully we'll have something I mean. In 1 months it doesn't out of time. But um, I think development was will be ready now content was I know get to doing her best and Um Yeah, and she's trying to have everything ready before the 19th. Most of the content. Was it before the 19th? And if there is still content uploaded to be done, uh while I'm away then I think before I leave Joan I said I set up a call with you. So um, I I can you know explain uh, if if I need your help on something it's probably just coordinating and uh, yeah being there forgetting kind question is helpful content uploads and things like that. Um, so we have someone from our team who can be there if she's like. Oh, yeah. Can you change this or can you add this copy there and the website structure would be ready, but then maybe that 100% of the content will be on the site. So, um, probably uh, Yeah Will mainly causes her on on this in the main types of&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>12:30</div><div>For the day for you. Anyway, at least well, actually we are here in Spain. We have some sunny days and these days and I will uh use this weekend to spend time with my daughter. Uh, you know trying to uh well to not waste any time with her or You know. But it's fine. It's fine. I don't know. What about you?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh, yeah she accept she did accept the call. Um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So we should be a a waiting for her. She's the main uh, the main character here in this call actually. I think&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I'm gonna try. I'll let you leave the sheet thing is just to um, make sure we get the obviously the impact analysis. We need about the clear that we're&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>There's a risk obviously to at least Africa, um because we also don't have any design so we can't actually start any development until we get approved designs so we can start looking at what the requirements of the bones as well. Um, and then more than others with&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>When you're being on leave and rather than like is there anyone we can speak to or do we just have to accept that we're missing out a week and just explain the structure that we want to I guess the regular 1 to have a lot around this project to have. Um, 15 minutes scrum meeting to try and get momentum and get some commitment on dates and we need to really pull up credit time together. And we also need our quantity. You want to start with icon to confirm the date that they can commit to um, Like a cruise&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I'd like to keep things.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>An email coming in asking about I just make sure that you'll see soon has to show you aware of it. Okay, um, sorry, uh regarding a t Maria. Um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh What is the exact uh status on this? RDS still uh waiting yesterday, basically&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Right. I think they uh, the given are on Monday.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>And we are at the moment. They're waiting on the impact analysis, but their questions to us again to say that would be um, For Africa at least That they can be moved.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Like basically is that July data hard data can it shift? Um, which we can know I don't want to share that with them yet. But we need to get the Impact Services over. Oh, hi, how are you?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Good, how are you? Hi. Thank you.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Everything Sorry, I'm it's on.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh, yeah, you sound like it um for you but the cold Yeah a cold.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Something new&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh no. Oh, I hope you want to keep you too long. Thank you on the call today.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh, yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Sorry. Oh, yeah, that would be everybody as well. Wouldn't it? Yeah. Okay cool. Um, hope they're going to leave us a call and I'll just jump in um after any questions from Powell. Um, yeah. Thank you Maria I have for my side. Well, I will just like to briefly, uh, share the uh, status and update on the status on this 2 projects, um, because uh, we would like to clarify on the deadlines as uh taking into account that we are advancing April. Um, but the current statutes is that regarding domains will I do confirm that the domains has been registered for uh, some of the Arabia, uh, so they are able and actually uh regarding&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um Uh, well, we would like to clarify, uh regarding Africa regarding timelines for Africa because it has for an impact analysis so they can make their priority decision among their other current priorities. Um, uh, We would like to uh, try to avoid risk on Africa deadlines. So actually regarding it they are asking for explanation from business on impacts, uh for delays. Um, Uh, so first I think is can we help I understand?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>But but I mean&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Hosted on Alec there is no massive impact that they can come back to us within whether the the timeline would be as long as we transition and like But July August 10th is fine, but we just need to make sure it's done before Q3. So it depends what kind today to be looking at. Uh, I don't anticipate the business impact because other patients are up and running.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, so for for KSA because essentially they have to send up a whole new infrastructure blocker while waiting on them to confirm that but we're kind of stuck in the middle because it's like a chicken and egg. They're asking us. Basically that you have a hard date. Um, yeah, well, I guess for both projects, but I guess pay Africa is the main concern for the first Sight I told her I had said that it was yet because it looks like it might I need to pick up the ticket earlier to review it. I guess starting the work earlier as a different story. But KSA was like the also the thing that the base flag because there were other Items on the list for KSA and they went aware that a new website was needed and I think it's just the natural issue of yeah. The infrastructure element of that so obvious extend, but I know that KSC is a non-negotiable in terms of that delivery date. But in order to do 1 we need the infrastructure for both so it it like um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Jewel&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>But we can say that if you've got information that you can share on your impact of that I'm concerned about that's the end is something definitely I can share with you. Yeah, but you can share&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Anyway, but make it very clear that okay. So this is the impact because that's going to be the driver. Um, in order for them to at least try and start the work earlier or be prioritized their workflow. So they can start these the structure work earlier, but because that wasn't anticipated or so were being told they have to stand up with you. Servers. Um, yeah, so if you can provide that impact, okay, so because my worry would be that it would be at the low so Africa, but that would impact unintentionally and I don't want that to happen.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Sure. Yeah, that is something I can put in writing definitely and share that with you. Is there a template or just share the usual business? No, I think just share from their email. I did ask for a template. It didn't provide anything. So I think just share what you have and obviously if they go down a template route, then I can push back and say well You just offer impacting the relationship. She didn't say a template you just wanted a reasoning and and so that we can give you um, so I guess anything you have if there needs to be something that comes from I don't know lean. Or or higher or something, um or any commitments that you've already agreed to?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Directors buddy as well. Any of that information will be super. Helpful Okay. Sure. I'll put that on your email. Yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No, it's fine. Just let us know if I we we can or if I can help some Cloud, uh with that so yeah, because um what I think uh it uh, this information won't be ready next week if right if I'm not wrong because of the Ramadan and this is great. Okay. Okay. No, it's fine because well, I'm trying to uh starting tomorrow. I'm I I would like to take a care, uh regarding deadlines actually, uh, because yeah, as I commented we are now, uh in April and we would like to uh,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Start advancing somehow for example regarding the signs, um that uh, Dunya said that it was uh, this was working in parallel and this is something that we can start. Um, yeah pushing up in in sorry in parallel. So, uh, I'm not done didn't uh set a clear date on when uh, we can expect the draft of the signs. So, Um in this, uh interim in this uh week, uh, can we uh, Speak uh or can with uh, somebody I Quantic directly while de is on leave to try to get any any draft regarding the signs. Do you have any contacting in a quantity?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yes. Yeah, of course. So, um They've had you the layout and the brand Team where uh sharing some feedback so still uh work in progress and they just shared the latest set of feedback today, but this is I can send you this and I put you in contact with eye contact So to avoid any further details along with the latest, uh, Set of feedback that was sent So to avoid any uh details.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Delays, yeah, yeah. But they'll be in they're going to be up next week as well right with E now if they actually based the demo based on your&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, no, okay. No, no, no. Oh perfect, but we can continue having with conversations with them. Well you guys are. Pretty expensive Yeah, okay. So are you okay if I if we uh contact directly with with them? Yeah, yeah, I'll send this and share with you the latest.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>To Just For This&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>To enter things. Um, and you if you uh when I share your own feedback as well. Please do. Great, great. Thank you. I will put in copy and Junior of course and all the team. Yeah, but thank you. It is really helpful.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No anything else for my side just uh, it could be great to have clear dates regarding this so I will try to uh move forward this.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Oh great. Um just for my side, um, I thought thanks for getting my information. I'm just sharing that now and I'm responding to I think it's Tina. Um, yeah.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I'm going to include them in. A team of email training along with Dino who's kind of like cognizant of the channel Account Manager on stigma just to help with the SW process. If it looks like has the 1 that done you might have used to try and extend it in essence too old. We'll have to do a new SSL for you. Um Which just means that process to do that, unfortunately, um, so I'm just letting the cognizant know that they'll pull together the draft S&amp;W pretty quickly. Um So we can make that in parallel along with all the other conversations. I think the only thing Um, I don't know if you have an update in terms of the subdomain, uh, sorry the domain purchases. I don't know if we're still waiting on those.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Dots essay&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um, and then I just thought about that just now. Um, it's all excuse me to check happy on those in terms of what what's happening. Hmm. Sorry actually, uh, there are 5 domains registered. Okay is the first 1 is Sima Dash <a href="http://sa.com">sa.com</a>. Uh&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Then we have Sigma sa that is it is already registered. I mean that I am able to see the the correct who is records. Okay for this, uh for this domain and also <a href="http://sa.com">sa.com</a> sa sa insolence essay and sin, uh, because well, it seems like uh regarding, um,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Regulations in Saudi Arabia. Um, uh Healthcare the World Health Care is not indicated in the name in the commercial registrations, uh for Sigma. So the request for this domain is not able to to be performed in in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>12:46</div><div>Okay, okay. But the only the only 1 domains have been registered is the the list that I have shared with you with the team in by email. There are 5 domains registered for for Saudi Arabia. Okay, and there is no there is no new domain for for Africa.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, uh So is there a way around?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That those domains with Healthcare. See and what's tricky about Saudi is the name that we are using the marketing name. We are using is Sigma Insurance Saudi Arabia. As the marketing name use across all collateral, but then the licenses you right? You said the signal Worldwide Insurance and then the brand itself. It says Sigma Healthcare. So, uh, so so we we kind of need to be consistent. But at the same time we need to own all of these. Uh, well if you're okay I can retake.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh this uh with the with Kati in order to clarify or just in case uh, Uh, we can send another document.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>To you. There's some sort of echo. Oh, sorry.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>No, I was saying that if you are, okay, I can uh retake this item with Katy just in case they need another uh documentation. We can send them in order to to go ahead with this signal <a href="http://healthcare.com">healthcare.com</a> essay domain. Is it okay? Okay. Yes, of course.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay. Okay. I can I can ask her but that's good progress. Thank you for purchasing that no, it's okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Check, okay.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, so for my size anything else so okay then from my end. I will share the designs that. By 20 cents a lot along with the feedback. I Loop you in feel free to share your feedback as well. Um, and then of course most importantly the business impact, uh, which I need to be put on email. Uh, I'll also let uh lean know that uh, this is happening. So if she has separate conversations with a respective senior stakeholder, she can take it forward. And uh You will um, yeah on the sigma, uh Healthcare, it's nice if we have a way forward with kenty to see what we can do. Okay? Okay, okay. Yeah, I do. Sure. All right. Perfect. Awesome. Um, I've got a catch up with Richard on Monday, so I don't know if you can send something. Bye. If not, not a problem. And we'll just wait until you can send something because you know, me and Tech manager. I just want to try and get something back to it. It subconsciously spoke with um, I think it was like last week and before we could break. So I just yeah, I don't want too much radio sites in between cuz then they're just going to see if it's not&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That important and I kind of want if you want to make sure that when you just keep the momentum pushing to try and get things on Lots. Um, I'm going to see how much I can do with Richard how I mean I think worst case if I need to so at the moment, I'm currently reporting for smash directly on the interim. So I kind of want to be able to utilize that while I have it. Um before we I get someone who's reporting to so I think it works if I need his help to remove any blockers who will be willing to do that. Um, I had a first once more of him on um, Wednesday and he said that that's basically kind of what his role is. So I'm just trying to figure out his leadership style and and how to get him involved, but we want to Use him um to soon and I kind of just use his name. Yeah, you know the same thing yesterday. She asked me if I want uh, because she has the 1 and 1 with some mesh coming up and if we should bring this up, uh, and I told her it's more that I see him structure infrastructure that we need to look at for any, uh, I'll get back to her on that. So I think because she's been obviously reporting it to the so much longer than that. She's got like a standard relationship. So I think&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, I would. Was that if she mentioned it definitely after to raise it, I guess if she needs more information, um from me I'm more than happy to provide that I guess she um should um seeming the 1 to 1 is going to happen. Once you're all back from Eid, right? Uh know she's working next Leah's working. She's working next week.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh, there should be in Europe. Okay, awesome, um there even back to so I can always give her um an update our basically what I'll do, I'll just ask Richard to turn it down in an email to me just in layman terms so I can share what the issue is. So I have it ready in case you oh yes some more information. Um, so you can just put me into Oh, okay. I'll do that. Hey, Richard, 34439 is into who?&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So he is part of um ID, ihds but he reports into he's like infrastructure. So I think he has to report online. I want to say 10. Plus. I just I want to double check that when we get that wrong.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um Yeah, so his reporting line.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Uh&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In my face&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>I was wrong. So yeah. Oh, yeah, so it goes is um Basically front prices would be his direct connection into the mesh. So his reporting line. Is that wrong? Gary Duncan, right the Frank price and then the mesh essentially. Yeah. Okay. Okay, that's clear.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Yeah, so I mean which is basically which is like up my it for there isn't doing you can't really do the doing himself on a lot of these things, but you can help me navigate, um and have those conversations with it. So I think when I we have these blockers like forming in it, the conversations are less strained from my perspective, um, because he can help I guess all the all the friends there or it always seems like a big thing, but he can help kind of break that down and simplify it. Very Yeah, he's really good. So I basically he was given to me by the team. So the transformation team last year and he's and he was on the it pool. And again, I think what we just want to do or to impress on the impact analysis is I just want to show that we followed the whole process. Um, so if I've got that anywhere escalating they can't turn on and say oh but they didn't follow the process and I was explaining why it took, you know ages to get this motion we needed to pull together and obviously again that infrastructure discussion that was new information to Jose and I in our mind we were going to use these listing um infrastructure for the Middle Eastern and you know, they did a communicate that there was a project happening because of whatever it issues or vulnerabilities so other concerns that's not an us problem. That's a demo. These are things that should be communicated to the business, especially when it impacts them directly. So Um, I think the good news is that they would pick up the ticket earlier. So they did discuss what would needed to be done and the preference not the Preference they did today. We need to build this um new infrastructure. Um, cuz that's that's practice. We can't build anything on the existing cuz we'll have to move things in the Middle East eventually. Um, the question is just how quickly they can start the work. So I have a cat that was rich in on Monday. To see if he can help us to move it forward so we can reach out to them. But I just want to make sure I share that impact analysis and science. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>So I can I'll get richer to 10 something for me. Um, and if you send an email to me, um, this is the end and I can give her the information she needs. Um so she can transfer me to work, okay. Yeah, uh, okay. I'll I'll try to put together in this email over the weekend. Um&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Ambassador approach&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>And I'm currently in right now. I'll copy you. Okay. Pardon. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you and everything from our side. Um, how did you have anything else? And that was all the point? No, no, everything is fine for my side. Thank you.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Okay, if you just send a follow-up email just so um, we'll curve but I think that actions um, and then thank you before your please.
