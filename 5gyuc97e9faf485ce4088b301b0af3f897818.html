They might be pronounced slightly differently, or have an extra ending or prefix, but the core words have made it around the world&mdash;this time, even to Chinese.</div><div><br></div><div>☕️ COFFEE</div><div>Like the other food words on this list, there was a time when coffee was unknown in much of the world.&nbsp; As it was traded and adopted in communities worldwide, the Arabic word&nbsp; قهوة qahwah was adopted along with it&mdash;and in the variants of qahwah you can see how languages tweak the sounds of a word to make it their own!</div><div>The Arabic "q" sounds is produced at the back of the throat, so other languages used whatever sound they had at the very back of the mouth (typically a "k" sound like in English coffee). The "w" in the Arabic word was also often replaced (not all languages have a "w" sound!)&mdash;the Turkish word kahve uses the "v" sound which is also made at the lips. It's the Turkish word that was borrowed into many European languages, and so you can see an additional change from "v" to another lip sound: the "f" you know from English coffee, Spanish caf&eacute;, Italian caff&egrave;, etc.</div><div><br></div><div>&#127851; CHOCOLATE</div><div>And alongside that hot cup of joe is the word for chocolate: It's the same everywhere around the world! If a language has a word for this confection, then it's based on a Nahuatl word or phrase for a drink made of ceiba and cocoa. The Spanish version of this word (probably quite a bit different from the original Nahuatl word) has been borrowed by communities worldwide.</div><div>When other communities and languages adopted this new food, they slightly altered the pronunciation and spelling to match their language. For example, German and Russian replaced the "ch" sound with "sh," and Japanese added "o" to the end of the English word since Japanese words can't end with "t" sounds.</div><div>Just like with the other semi-global words in this post, chocolate gets this honor because the food and idea of chocolate itself originated in one region and was unknown elsewhere&mdash;so when people first learned about the food, they learned the word for it at the same time, too. They went hand in hand! And as the product spread around the world, that single word was carried along for the ride.</div><div><br></div><div>So the world over, some variation of coffee and chocolate will get you exactly what you're hoping for!</div></content></body></html>
