And give your team the freedom to complete their tasks by themselves and focus on removing blockers for them so they can get back to what they do best: the role you hired them to do.</div><div><b>Create small groups within the team and put someone in charge for each particular group. </b>This way you can slowly reduce direct supervision.</div><div><br></div><h2>Perfectionist behavior often leads to never-ending Revisions</h2><ul><li><div>If the quality of the work satisfies all the necessary criteria, don&rsquo;t ask for endless revisions anyway.</div></li><li><div>Make sure you give your teammates the freedom to make mistakes. Fear of &ldquo;messing up&rdquo; can stifle innovation.</div></li><li><div>Have a limit on the number of revisions, and stick to it.</div></li><li><div>Before delegating, imagine what is the worst that could happen if the task is not accomplished on time, or if it is not up to expected level. Then, regulate your involvement according to the possible severity of the lapses.</div></li><li><div>Set realistic goals&mdash;both for your teammates and yourself.</div></li><li><div>Your feedback should be guidelines, and not a checklist. Instead of showing your teammates <i>how</i> to do a particular task, give them bigger-picture pointers.</div></li><li><div>When a team member does exceptional work, give them public praise and be sure to specify exactly what you liked so much and why it was successful so they can replicate those positive features next time.</div></li></ul></content></body></html>
