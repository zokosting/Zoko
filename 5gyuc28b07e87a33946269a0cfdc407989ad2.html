Why sure exactly how you want to get updated teacher. Do you want to <div><br></div>Give some background information for the project and the main issues are main questions. You would like to wait. <div><br></div>Okay, um I can because I stopped at this we're working with me like their own teams that Bo and dryers are on the call from a why they were actually doing a race before a migration of a campaign for stress care. So we've got a few micro sites that currently sits on Eliquis and we need to my Great, those awful aqua and 16 sites. So Fabio an entire team help not to do that development work and then there's some except for projects that they're also working on are working on for us which again is being built in teamfights. Oh Sylvia has been lead of your project management perspective just because of our resources quite low and the team is accused of supporting. So we're both in trying to help with access in terms of technology technology. Warm as it has access to Sigma platform. So the build work is going to be in the Civil Air International instance between sites and I believe it is why they're in team. I shouldn't have rushed. This has some questions about the setup is just checking it got the right environment to commence work. Hopefully that's a nice intro summary of what we're doing and for Fabio and graded you want to people <div><br></div>And very shortly that gives you a summary identity, but any questions, but if not Fabio or Drea to jump in with that question, so if it should be a long School <div><br></div>So the pages mother is going to be developed with the existing component of what we are available on the sigma International or is going to be a pure HTML. <div><br></div>Simply let me throw ice cream out. So the stress has different variations of this design. So we've got a mix of new and old and the new design use them as components really good. It's gonna be HTML fields, which is going to migrate. <div><br></div>Okay. Cease actually one of our questions are there any components that we can reuse these things? They just honor we simply constructed the whole pages from your HTML. VW. Yeah. <div><br></div>That's why because I probably wouldn't know that question is that we've got I think it's going to have to be your HTML but might have to do with kind of knock on some elements. So for example, they think is the gih how's the latest version that helps uses elements of components that are not like to like so they've used for example, there's a heritance and it looked like they used to <div><br></div>Design from the components and in the international incident team site, but it's not the exact same so it will still be development. What does that make sense? I think but he's it might just be better to take to no pills being site and things like that. It's just not going to get a like-for-like and it will probably be longer work trying to figure out the differences and that's actually will be more different than his matches. Oops <div><br></div>Okay, so we do everything from its them up. Okay. Yeah, I mean help with that. If you do want to just be welcome Penance we have I think money and we can share as the library. I'm guessing it's upon the same I received yet, but we can share that fabulous with the team jump the you got to see them. <div><br></div>I understand from film when he talks the same Who currently. <div><br></div>We got will also we need up for the coastal everything everything. <div><br></div>Content into that and Sigmund international branch. Okay, but first of all that we have eight versions, it means lights the its pages. All of them are going to be the signature National image or we will have different branches of the locations for each side. For example gah so on <div><br></div>Yeah, so I will double check but I think but he's from discussions we had with Chris it was to put it all in that they're going to National Ranch. So I would chase the answer because we do have other sites that for example, obviously, we've got a version of the stress tensor the Middle East and we do have a with Elysee website that's within team sites if it's a different instance of That brought which I think is the original access the I think what I just need to triple check is if we want to do that because it might be easy for some regions, but for example Singapore, I believe I have to like request that whole different. Like username for you to get access to the Singapore sites essentially or the double check so that they're just like this. Okay, and now it was in the National Broad and I will check with Chris today and send an update if anything changes. Okay. I'm very attached to add something there. We had a discussion with cocoa as well about online Wellness tool. <div><br></div>Maybe that was too large it first in the Middle East and they indeed also accept their preference closed it locally attack against see some benefits of their students can't make it make it easier to do the tagging probably but from a technical point of view. It's much easier to to centralize everything on signature National so I do <div><br></div>There's like you consistency needed in the approach. I will address that no, I tried to express that in an approximate just based on that but I think would be an issue because for example and the word coming in international incidents indistinct dialogue as we can access the Middle East and we can grant I should believe we can grant the team access to <div><br></div>Middle East technical label the axes and disappear even Cigna health benefits by George's it was required. So I think we can cover most I just need to confirm if we want to do that localized approach because of the original art was great to be Central. It was very much focused on building a nest egg. No International so different like I different Do you think about the possibilities that you mention any other markets they were brother out two of the monthly or which is a good start for what did they have to be able to look at my notes? I do believe that the second in the second case. They were thinking about the second Singapore and perhaps that was a big question mark <div><br></div>Europe in the latest so Little Italy definitely skirts <div><br></div>I think the early the complexity will try to look like I think what maybe with the more the Big C Market in a part. So we have anything for we want to get some coffee. I won that where I suggested to like gets a different type of access, so I have just not been. <div><br></div>I'll pick up Fabio. I will get back to you ASAP. They just back there will be probably two different approaches for stress care and the ones to understand correctly so scary we'll probably go everything you have into Sigma International model for the women school will be there. There's a possibility we will have. Don't use that localized. Yeah, I guess I'm just sick. But he's of time. I've is it possible just to provide them the team access to the local instances or the different Regional sites. If I send a perhaps i'ii, send you a list of what this looks like. I need to provide the basic editor axis at they need. I'm sure Maria and if they are trying to update the history of Moline Moline, I'm not sure if you are sharing the screen it will go under the asserts not under the side because side will have all the dog cages. So under the answers, we have the resources or the third one over here. We have the HTML. So whenever we created or page The Dot Page will get generated to history. Ml. <div><br></div>And it will be added over here since the team is going to update the HTML directly like they can able to update over here. If it is not an adult page version of it. That makes sense. <div><br></div>Here's a stunning both they can able to import the instrument over here. There was came for the HTML and then we need to create the page, right? <div><br></div>If they are trying to obtain upload the history of my directly they can go to the resource folder and upload the HTML. But if they find like okay, they they do the Dot Page. They go to the sites and create the Dot Page. We will have a subfolder dedicated to our Pages or we will have to mix those pages in the existing polarity. I think it would be better to input everything contained in a subfolder. <div><br></div>Yeah that whatever name you you had to this folder. It would probably be I think included in the URL. You may want to think of the name that you know the name of this for the because it will be very possible that we are you are. <div><br></div>Okay, I'm sorry for the URL path. This means that all of the pages will be under the Cygnet relational top-level domain or like now we will have different domains. <div><br></div>So I will confirm that question in terms of the different from a like it what Marlene is saying is that regardless of the language for example, if you use of crates and djh my first bite in the dense National incidence, the subfolder name is not Julie be reflected in the URL that will just have to Eric why other than forces were still people all the market system kinds of what that main would be if we have centralized anything. We don't have to centralize everything. The main will have the market may remember but the we'll just have to like that's the folder name again. We'll have to let you guys know what that needs to be. But for example, it will go into local artists and we say okay the Middle East Middle East Side. <div><br></div>Defend the least the main which is That's extra dozen. Both last spell the name of the father what we call it stepped care. So we just have to get the naming convention won't be at what different direction and what they purchase their place of employment. The pizza yes. Yes. Alright. Yeah, so I think we will have two different the Align this with Bill there is already so on all the current pages in The Local there is a naming conventions conventions for the for the URL. So for example for Signal Middle East is its constant signal that comes with that is a lokva URL and then / check in - Emmy - Videos for example, so the local markets abbreviation is always like in between and the first part is the well it was taken but we will be probably renaming that to stress care. <div><br></div>10:52<br>Are so I think if we had come from but so will confirm of it's such a life and that's like this and that will determine that naming convention. Did it look like that if they need to have a region name in the folder URL This is this also it's for resources. So for example speeds images and so on use the same naming conventions within folders. <div><br></div>Images with news media would find it here under static images here again. You probably need to create the right folder. If you want to add the images related to these pages and for any document you would add it in. <div><br></div>You would put your resources at stake. <div><br></div>So what's a folder? <div><br></div>Here we don't have any stuff for the whole night. Yes, but if you want to create a separate folder you can do it, okay? <div><br></div>Is there a I think I mentioned that there is some kind of workflow that you are there to that. We might be able to follow for example for staging approval publishing. So one another to avoid them making. Ex. Yes exactly. So we have the development site that you can use that will be like the first and when you should order the workflow step before publishing it you can review it in sight so <div><br></div>We can pick it up separately, but you can use the development site for review. Look at what we can do. I just will make we can still provide what though the radiance URL bar but we can start at the less depending on what we spent like four like likely to give that the workplace the journey the same so <div><br></div>Keep pushing the stake in week noise left with no it and push the fragrance so we can review it and then we will always get going off to say yes, everything's fine or if it needs changes before we push it. Okay, so you do Maria pushing it to production? <div><br></div>No today can push all the way but normally what they do is so different The Vedic that they didn't and we chat. We will check and give the okay for when they can for now. I'm just asking because for example with the Cigna health benefits website that we created last year there. We always need to ask it for the final production of this how know that we can first privately. <div><br></div>Michael doesn't have any involvement and he thought so I guess that's something to be aware of that. If we have to they might just be some if we expect we'd be afraid to do that allowed to look like Bruce and there might be maybe to idea enjoyed it and people advising process for I guarantee. Oh, yes, there is one. So if it's localized for example there to like finally publish the pages then you would need to ask itu press the button. Don't you think so? The Navy is for example breakthrough idea maybe cities that centralized that we have control over that because we don't really want the stuff you next year. I don't know. It's just I don't know what their process is when they push to production. It doesn't take long. It's just that you just need to be mindful or and it might take a little while. So if you need something like published like this instance all you need to know that you just have to make that request. Okay, I'd like today or no. I think it's a couple of hours. <div><br></div>The Bop <div><br></div>If we don't like intelligence, I think Fabio every what every other site literally you can push the prod yourself apart from the NCI job sites, which looks like we have to get approval from IT service and they would push it to production. Okay. <div><br></div>Okay, let's point this way from our main questions so far about the worst during the development that being an environment that's shared between teams. And also, of course we know that in our not totally our loner. I think there will be the need for other discussions and questions in the future. So I would like to have some contact point with which we can discuss the details of working people. I don't think how I don't know how and to we can contact we can establish should away to have some discussion. It would be very very Used <div><br></div>But I couldn't catch that so you can heat up a contact like Sylvia would it be you will take the the p.m. And then you can put it to the right so you can pull up there when you need them. Yes. Yes as you get more somewhat consoled point where he might just keep secret, but you probably come back to my team like the questions because we if we need to sign anything with Argentine freaking awesome for you. Oh. My healthy off the register, which is sexy have knowledge of some of them all of them. I think initially the contact Itza and the first instance still busy need to be kept in the loop or is disability EMS. I think it would be <div><br></div>That's what I was going to say. I would just say in of employees and they can respond depending on what the Picking up what they will do is if they need my hands assistance, they will engage with look like they need directly like for somebody from my team. So I've got a team meeting and acceptance that we could discuss the best person for my team. So teachers overstated. I know we can help as much as possible from there because I think a lot of those is going to be relevant to do my painting. <div><br></div>Okay, very good. Thank you very much. I think that's for now that it's all from our side and I don't know if other questions or problems. <div><br></div>I have any questions either. I've been a lie saying. No, we're just confirming the approach. Basically what we expect to learn to look like against that wall. Aye know pretty quickly. So I don't really was make that decision so he can pick up separately and then grab your bible. <div><br></div>Send an email to I should be like this just so we've got a list of all the local domains that it's brought you access to so we'll just do that. Anyway, just in case and then what we can do is provide a list of it does environment as well. So you have a future reference just in case And then it goes for once we understand that the approaches that we can verify naming conventions so we can have a setup, correct. <div><br></div>Okay, great. <div><br></div>The other thing is I saw your email yesterday. So but the three additional resources that we have just looked ticket, which what's that gonna prove it will allow me to the right the other ticket for access. The only thing question I have what you seek those things. <div><br></div>Download the trial version of the of them visual DS visual Studios was that resolved. We have the full version because I sent an email to see this. I didn't hear anything after I don't know if stop it will have to reuse the version of visual features that you have at the moment. But today or if the full version house. Okay, I'm asking until this. I think we might need to let you but what can we say? Yeah, we just need the professional one. So last time I checked my assigned for no desktop. I saw that it was installed in 2017 version if it could be possible to update into 2019 would be better. So the professional one is required. <div><br></div>I haven't. Yeah, I haven't followed up on that yet. But you did you submit some kind of ticket somewhere or just an email? No, I think Steven just wanted an email. Yeah email, but I didn't hear any good back. So I would have so if that just made forward with the out of that discussion fine. <div><br></div>I'll send him a Skype message if I can get a quick answer on that one. <div><br></div>Thanks Irish. <div><br></div>Okay, thank you. I thank you. I thank you. </div></content></body></html>
