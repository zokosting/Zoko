These people were involved in turning away from politics, away from bureaucracy, and toward a world in which they could change their consciousness. They believed <b>small-scale technologies</b> would help them do that. <b>They wanted to change the world by creating new tools for consciousness transformation.</b></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Stewart Brand <span style="font-weight: bold;">actually calls computers &ldquo;the new LSD.&rdquo;</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></div><div>Any utopianism tends to be a totalizing system. It promises a total solution to problems that are always piecemeal. So the problem from my perspective isn&rsquo;t the technological part of technological utopianism but the utopianism part. Any whole-system approach doesn't work. <u>What I would recommend is not that we abandon technology, but that we deal with it as an integrated part of our world</u>, and that we engage it the same way that we engage the highway system, the architecture that supports our buildings, or the way we organize hospitals.</div><div>The technologies that we've developed are infrastructures.But we need to start thinking about them as ordinary as tarmac.</div><div><br></div><div>But the people who get most of the attention in the Valley are the big CEOs. I think that the vision of the Valley as a libertarian space is a combination of actual libertarian beliefs held by people like Peter Thiel and a celebration of libertarian ideals by an East Coast press that wants to elevate inventor types. Steve Jobs is the most famous. <i>East Coast journalists want to rejuvenate the American hero myth&mdash;and they&rsquo;re going to find a world to do it in. In order to make these heroes, however, they have to cut them off from the context that produced them. They can't tell a context story. They can't tell astructure story. They have to tell a hero story. Suddenly the heroes themselves look like solo actors who pushed away the world to become the libertarian ideal</i> of an Ayn Rand novel.</div><div><br></div><div>I have a theory, and I offer it to you as a pocket theory. <u>So my pocket theory is that different eras have different focalcommunities&mdash;places they use to think with.</u> In the late nineteenth century, it would have been Edith Wharton's New York. Or maybe a little later, Theodore Dreiser&rsquo;s Chicago. Dreiser&rsquo;s Chicago became a place that people used to think through the consequences of the rise of industry. All sorts of things that weren't unique to Chicago, like immigration, became things that people thought about in that space. <u>I think the Valley is where we do our thinking now about gender and sexuality.</u></div><div><br></div><div><u>Now, we FaceTime.</u> There's no withheld gratification. Romance of the kind that I grew up with was something that took time. <u>It required restraining your desires. It required thinking about another person.</u> I mean, one of the most erotic things you can do with a person is think about them, right? Just think about them. <u>That's different in a world where you can press a button and their face appears. The possibility of push-button sexuality (as an object)</u> is very much alive in the Valley.</div><div><br></div><div>-Dont' Be Evil (Fred Turner)</div><div><a href="https://logicmag.io/03-dont-be-evil/">link</a></div></content></body></html>
