That's a lot a lot of mix mix.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Okay.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Hi and welcome, welcome everyone to the town hall. So as you as you were joining the meeting and enjoining the sessions you will have so um some of the testimonials that have came from our our customers which shows clearly how we support our customers and how we are there for their needs um day to day and that's why what we that's why we do what we do day-to-day and why we do it so well at Sigma So just a welcome everyone. We're in Greenock.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First first time in a while in Greener and I'd like to welcome samet Chandra the CEO, um of international markets also our ihds senior leadership team are here and they will be open for questions later and then more importantly to you guys huge fantastic turnout, um in the beacon art center today, so we're live from the beacon Arts, which is just about a a 7 minute walk away from the office. So a big thanks to everyone who's turned out in person and also for you guys that have joined, um remotely, So I think we thanks everyone I think first big thank you for hosting us here. We were tricked by telling it's lovely weather and a great venue venue is great. I think we still are looking for the Sun but hopefully you'll get it tomorrow. Um, I think this is great to be with all of you. And as I said, we're trying to be as close to all of you as possible. So spending each of our quarters and the town halls in person. So this time in greenoff, so first time in greenoff for a town hall so great. Um, and then of course the second ihds town hall and I'm very glad to have my leadership team here, but also said the from the ilt and some of my other leaders as well. So we are all here and thank you very much for hosting us. We're having some great conversations and looking forward to many more in the next few days. Thank you. Okay, I swear I'm not so sure what you're talking about reference to the whether it's a fabulous day in and green out here today. So we want to kick off. It's been a while since we've been in green up. So we just want to kick off with some um key facts about green art. Um and just some um, Some of the things that that happens in the area so given the degree oxide so we have 460 staff which are linked to the green up site and we have um, 1 staff member that has a whopping 34 34 years length of tenure and that's exactly when we move when Sigma moved into green up and we had a presence in green up and in 1990 in 1992. We moved to nor road, which is the facility that we are in just now and&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Right. We actually opened up our Euro care platform in 1992. So that that's just shows you how how long ago that was. We have a really long length of tenure and experience in the green up site. So we have just over 9 years of of tenure so that brings with it a lot of experience and and a lot a lot of knowledge and also a commitment from our staff that it is a nice place to be and there are development opportunities there.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The books of business that we serve. Um, we serve our gih our GHB EU and also our our uh, domestic book of business, um at the moment and we've got representation from lots of nationalities. So when you look at Belgium Canada France and the Netherlands Singapore South Africa and Spain, And for those European countries that are within the Euros, we've got a huge Euros presence in the office and we bought a lot of competition there as to to what team is going to come out on top. So that's that's really been good for everyone to get involved. We also support Asia pack and their China and Middle East, um business lines and we serve in in multiple languages in Greenup.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Supporting our community we had the option to do a volunteering event. Um yesterday it was good good for the first half of the day and then as our SLC arrived on site the rain the heavens opened up and and the rain came down the woman's AIDS were hugely appreciative of the the support that we've given them. Um, and also the work that you guys done that came along to that volunteering event. Thank you so much. It was like a garden makeover between the morning and and the afternoon, so it was it was really really appreciated from the women's Aid team.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A few things about green and you might just think that you know, it's a small town but we we are hosting this year alone 90, um cruise ships, they'll come into the terminal just just beside us and with those cruise ships and and maybe some of you have the opportunity to see some of the dolphins that are around behind jumping out the water. The cruise ships bring with them 120,000 passengers per year. So it's a huge um lift into the economy of bring up. Um, and they are well and received as they arrive.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We also have just just outside behind us. And and when the blinds go up the guys in the room will be able to see we have a sunken ship. That's that's visible H 1 of our Industries in Greenup was um the Sugar Factory. So the boats carrying sugar there was a storm an accident and the the ship actually went over. Its the 2 of us attraction today and you can actually go out and see um, you can have a look around the the Shipwreck. Also just to touch on a couple of um, couple of things other things for getting us up was a a huge ship Builder industry along with Port Glasgow. So we've got as you come in to the town you'll see the the scale piece. That's a a figure that's been erected to to to as memory of the The the ship builders And then also we have the Leo Hill which is our our Constructors in the 1800s, which is a a fantastic Scenic. Um Opportunity if you ever get the the chance, then you can look around the the whole of Ember cloud. So just a couple of points to mention as an intro to Green up. No, I think just to add I think you're completely agree with you want this is every time I come here. I see it says so much of purpose in all that you do and yesterday when we spent time with the women's a volunteering event. It was very obvious. Um, it was funny because I had pretty much every everybody from all the teams from infrastructure to it to all the functions. I felt we could actually do a full project over there because it's difficult to catch all of them in the same place. I was tempted but I didn't do that but I think the reality is that um, it's great to see everybody coming together for a purpose and that's very well reflect.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So thank you very much for that. And and we're looking forward to building that more because we'll talk more about some of the initiatives we are doing but of course greenhoe has been and will be a very important part of what we do in the future as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Okay. Thank you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So again, how how well do we know our our senior leadership team? Um, and I think we'll we'll move to to some questions if we've got some questions in the audience to to just dig a little bit deeper and and get to know um our team&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ohio&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>2 questions for you today. So the first question is, um, we know that priority is the member provider and the client portals, but what is planned for updates in terms of the policy admin systems?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, so that's uh, we're starting. Uh, hi. Yeah is it? Um, so on the policy Administration systems, so as you know, we have multiple ones you mentioned that we have 1 that is what 90 32 32 years old. I think we were trying to figure out when the Mainframe.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Was started which is probably even earlier. Um, And we have more recent ones like diamond.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And now more in touch and so what we're trying to figure out right now is&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What systems need to be upgraded to how and at what point uh and the approach to do? Upgrade right if you if you think about it. A 32 years old system As everybody's input. And what signal has been doing for 30 years? So there's a lot of knowledge in there that needs to be. Extracted understood Before we can Port it to another. Start to another system, right? So the approach we taken now is actually looking at all the systems and extracting what the commonalities are like so you have CCI, which is a project a company claims intake. So we're trying to figure out should this be the same process. Can it be the same process across all the different businesses? And little by little we looking at can we extract some of that some of those capabilities from those systems? So we reduce the dependencies. On the systems right and when we make them a little bit. Less reliant on them. We'll make them a little bit dumber from our processes of your point, right? So that eventually they just become systems of record. Where we do minimum amount of transactions It still maintain all the history and side-by-side and we build more capabilities outside. So that's the first approach we take and the second. I guess the second act uh axis around the change. Is looking at Target systems that are more recent and can we reuse those? To eventually migrate the business on it. Right? So right now we're doing is we have um project with um in KSA. That's using the InTouch platform. We can learn a lot from that platform, right? It's a originally a TPA platform. So there's we know it does claims really well for multiple different customers. So we're looking at integrating that capability into the KSA Market. We're learning a lot from it. We're modernizing that platform as well. So we we making it more modular. Um and from that learning and then we'll decide right? So what's can this be a carriage replacement eventually, right? So when you think about policy Administration system is you have to take into account all the knowledge that has accumulated Also, all the mistakes to be honest has accumulated over the years from the entire organization.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But also all the virtual systems around it, right? So so we're going to the approach is how can we extract some of the capabilities out? And is there a Target platform that we can reuse more modern more and more modular that we can eventually also Implement right and and Industrial of the system. So that's what we're doing on the paths, right? Um, but you also have to&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>14:11</div><div>So Other ones but taking into account that we have. Diamond this year so the North American System the US system has gone through a full. Like revamp they went from A client server architecture, which is was really hot in the 90s and I wasn't calling um to a web architecture. And that the team managed to do that in 18 months or so and that's modernization. Right? So give us a flexibility. It's fully digital or some of the web. Right, it's structured data so we can reuse all that so diamonds going on and even the main frame and I think the infrastructure team is here, but the main frame and The car is they're going through we don't see it, but they go through upgrades and the hardware and the systems, but obviously you still have the green screen which I guess is what you guys are. Pointing at at this point So that's that's what we're doing around the the paths and right now the strategy is so we're looking at in touch. Um and sort of trying to chip away at their capabilities little by little as much as we can so we won't do a big bang like There's a few projects that I've been told that we don't talk about. So we we're going to find out soon enough Big Bang talk about that, right?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And the next question is&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And how did you code your first 5 months at segment? And what's been your highlights during this time?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Which is great. I mean the experience has been great. The team has been great. So as far as the highlights. Um, I would say 1 is Honestly fairly the people that I've met, um, the second 1 what I've been very also impressed and Taking it back a bit is the pace of change. That's happening.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And the third 1 is the willingness the awareness and the willingness to challenge ourselves, right? So so on the people side, I've met people in Greenwood is my last office. Actually I have to say so thanks for inviting us, uh that I'm not been to um, Everybody. I've met received a really warm welcome. This tremendous knowledge about the business. Let's try this knowledge about our systems as well, which is great because you have people with long tenure but that means we actually can go back very often in insurance. You have people who operate systems and they don't really know to be honest with you. So that's pretty scary. Uh, so we have very strong knowledge. Um, and the teams have been very willing like the welcome was very warm every time everywhere. I wanted it, you know new guy coming in. I think there's been a lot of CIO of changes also, so that was like, how how long is this guy going to stay? So I'm hoping I'm going to stay here as long as we can as long as I can for the transformation the second 1 is the pace of change so we are Global business. But we're multiple lines of business in multiple countries. Plus we have domestic markets. Right. So the the the pace of change that is given by GHB it's given by ioh, which is now revamping and strategy we have gih which is going full on digital. Right? So we're gonna have to be very good at digital. Uh, and then we have the domestic markets which are putting new constraints what we've been doing which we've been used to operate as a global sort of global operating model, right? So we talked about signaling etc. Etc. These are Competitive advantages that we have that are now being challenged by the local markets. We need to figure out how do we retool ourselves and are we really have the operating system right? So Plus you have The Regulators. Sorry in every country asking questions about everything and we need to modify and change things all the time. So the pace of change has been for me is that standing is 1 of the highest and it's also quite exciting. I have to say The last 1 is the willingness to challenge the way we operate right because of all the changes that we have ahead of us. By the time&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And and it's a willingness to change. So any anybody you talk to right? They know they know we have to change and very often they know how to change. Right, but it's it's when you talk to a group of people this they know what they have to change. The question of the challenge now is actually how do we start tuning every part of the organization?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To make that change happen and so that every basically brain that we have in the room and the rest of the organization is contributing to the change. And for me that's going to be 1 of the highlights and I think Add more time. I would give some of the examples that we've talked with Matt on the agile projects, but that was it. So, thanks. Okay. Thanks for the question Jillian. We'll pick up and see these 2 maybe you know, I talk a lot. It depends on that. It means of that answer pattern of you get a question. Yes, Richard lovely and my first question is a personal 1. So do you prefer richer or lofty? And did you have your nickname prior to Sigma? Uh So I'll take the last.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Uh, yes, uh, the nickname was School. Uh, I went to a secondary school where they use your last name. Uh loft house was quite a mouthful. They may have had to use my name quite a lot and I'm not saying I was naughty I'm simply saying they may have had to use my name quite a lot so it became lofty and it might have been followed with stop that uh, so, uh, it stems from them. I prefer lofty just because it was ingrained when I was young. The only person that calls me rich is my mom when I do something wrong, so you can do that but 1 of 2 things will happen. I will Panic or I want to know who you're talking about, and I'm not being rude. I just want to know. Thank you lofty. Thank you. So I'm glad you didn't say Richard. Otherwise, I was not going to go. Well, so next question is a business 1 and it's around the projects that we have in play for corporations. Okay, thinking specifically about um, low value track and scanning and so we put a lot of support to those projects, um directly from SME within operations. So my question really is how do we tap into the project team, um to get more support to make those projects a success.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah. No, that's a tough thing right in terms of.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our project Consistent approach to what our project team means, uh, Matt's just in front of you. I'll give you a much better answer off. They just said when I get this, right We approach change differently subject to which of the many lines of business that Frank talked about right the extent to which essential team does work versus local teams versus functional teams whether that's Define what we need, whether that's how we support what we want to build or whether that's how we test and get live what we do, right? So 1 of the things that we're working very hard to do in line with some of the things that Frank said is look at where we have a common approach to that because the common approach helps us maximize efficiency. It helps bring a level of Simplicity to what we do. I'll give you a very real example, uh in certain markets. Determines whether we get a project manager or a business analyst or some project support is entirely discretionary. Whereas it should be a set of dog whales what rules for guard rails that say how complex is a change. How time critical is a change? What is it worth being who in terms of dollars or experience benefit? And that guides where we allocate this is because If you live in change delivery, which I have, uh, 25 years, the only thing definitely guarantee is demand is always going to outpace supply and how do logically explain to people Every idea is a good idea Let me refresh that 99% as a road is we have a good but actually we have to relatively Rank and compare what we did. So I would say working progress. We're looking to bring greater Clarity for all of you when you do change about actually, what's the basis to engage? How do we keep you engaged? Because the other thing we do varying not well is sometimes it can feel like just throwing it over the fence into an opaque process that you don't understand and you just from the kitchen to deliver the order and the only thing you know is it's going to be take too long be too cold and not really what you order. Okay? It's not efficient. It doesn't support some of the journey that Frank is talking about that we'd like to do. So we're going to bring a different level of transparency process rigor and commonality to how we do that moving forward. The other thing specific I think about it lvt. We have a an understandable disease and and I mean that genuinely in this business by virtue of 2 projects whose names. We probably want utter which is all of you in this room waited thousands of days for things to get better because it just got allocated to those 2 initiatives.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And our answer to everything is technology.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Actually, it isn't that it's a spectrum of change there are things and I know we're doing that on our we're using people to fill in the Gap now of automation, but there are still stages before having to change Global care to fix that. I could contemplate robotic process automation. I could as we grow in confidence where we use it like a gen AI so we need to start looking. At the demand and the problem but not just jump to I need to Global care change. We need to have that engagement over process where you all involved in the optimal solution and a common way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To all of you with the efficacy. I can see Robin not inch so I'm going to shut off.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, so my question is pristine, um, Steve given that we work across multiple regions each with their own processes and requirements. What? Funds to bring in alignment to the policy admin systems to accommodate this. Uh, thanks Sonia for that question and it links to both lofty and franks, uh responses as well. So I think the first piece is uh, and just going back again. It's not a big bang fix. So we have to look at a cross functional. Look at what do we have from a comparable process perspective? Can we unify some of the processes? We were just talking yesterday about the end to end Place process of the platforms. It's very different. Okay, and that doesn't allow you to kind of harmonize the way in which we can cross functionalize people who work, um, within particular books of business and kind of transfer that learning into other areas. So I think 1 of the things we're looking at at the moment is the lifting and shifting of the logic away from the platforms and that would allow us to create a potentially a common front end unit. Uh, unified interface that looks the same at the front the usability looks the same and it's comparable but actually it bolts on to what we've got in terms of the back end whilst we go through the Journey of having a look at the platforms and uh the way in which those platforms are operating and as we start to take that logic away from the platforms it allows us to kind of place that into a uh, a front end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>14:22</div><div>Quite the same across everything common cleanse intake is a good example of where we've started to look at that at the moment. So that was a it's a front end, uh, data capture piece that automates the upload of the data into uh at the moment diamond in the us and we're now just about to go live in Singapore on the global care platform. And then once we've done that on there, we can then roll out all of that learning into uh, the rest of the users with global care before we have a look at the other platforms as well. So that'll be a front end which is common across all of those platforms. So I think the the common story is Let's have a look at the process. Let's unify the processes. Let's have a look at the simplification of the processes and see what we can do to uh, bring those together more closely. And then at the very front end of that we then now know that we've got a single process for example coming, you know, the claims processed piece, uh into an interface that everybody can use and that just opens up so much more flexibility, but it's not going to be you know, it's not going to happen tomorrow, you know, it's a journey as we've just said which has got a lot of interfaces into the other functions within the business. Okay, thank you and second question. I know you've got Scottish Roots. So what is the most exciting part of this trip for you?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You can tell by my accent. Um So my family are from dump free and Galloway. Uh, so not too far away from here and I still have family in Sterling. I haven't told them I'm here because I'm still not decided if I'm going to meet them, but But as I was flying in I kind of looked out of the plane window and the first thing that grabbed me was uh, the patchwork of fields and scenery and it reminded me of running around the farm in Capri bringing the cows in um, you know, and stoking the fire up because we only the only way we got hot water was a kid was to stoke the fire up which then heated the water. Um, so but more importantly than that the 1 thing that I've made sure our people and I got here was I've had black pudding haggus and maybe a pint of tenants&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So that's the bit. I've really uh enjoyed them and back for.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sorry. Oh and Scottish folk songs, but I'm not going to continue next that, you know, maybe later maybe later. Thanks Sonia.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Hi, Dr. Stella. Do you see a future in GHP where our operations and clinical staff have people working in relationships? And if so, what does that look like? Um, in fact, I would start with some of the things which are already happening today. Um, we have um session with in Asia specifically where we are working with the customer service team clinical and PSO to actually train or Empower our customer service team with some medical terminologies are common things which come which you don't have to refer to the clinical team. You can either answer or actually give the GOP. So we are trying to streamline that in Asia. And even from our side we need help from customer service. So that's the work. We are doing a small pilot in the diamond platform. But many times our case managers are trying to reach members. We may not have a contact information or sometimes we are not able to reach them, but the same customer might be calling in right for something about the claim, but how can there? Be connected through a process which we can do it today. We don't have to wait for. Change or anything. So that's a small pilot. We are doing uh on the dining room platform and I'm also very energized by France's vision of how like we had this mindset that it's all about to be we have to link the system then only we can support or work better. Um, it's just an access things like a customer service team can access things and help Cloud so they can answer the customers and don't have to send emails. Back and forth. So I like what bank is coming with the vision of let's not focus on the system, but on the outcome, what is the customer experience? What's the problem? We are trying to solve so as that is coming. I think we still can do a lot today, um by which we can ease each other's pain and also support our members better. So these are 2 examples, but there is there are other things which are Coming up in this specific. Location we can always talk about it and see how we can work together. That sounds great. Thank you very much. I do have a second question. Um, I actually read from your LinkedIn profile that you teach meditation and yoga is that still something that you fulfill in your day-to-day life? Oh, absolutely. So I travel a lot in my work and I carry a big bag and my yoga mat is 1 where the track back without fail. So no matter where I am, whether it's in Australia or Dubai or in G. I start my day with yoga and meditation. It's like as basic as showering. I do it every day my yoga and breath work and whenever I'm not traveling I'm in the community. I also lead community events. Um, so like what she did yesterday that's my passion and I get a lot of energy doing that um day in and day out.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Hi Seth, my questions are for you if that's okay, um exciting opportunities within the business Excellence team and and what they bring to the operational team as well, too. Can you share maybe some of the work that you're planning and to do or deliver over the next year?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for the question. Good to see you. Um so value is the keyword there, right? Uh, and we're obviously Pi is 1 vertical in in business accelerate which delivers a lot of value on the medical cost side, but on the operational side, we have been looking at a lofty mention RPA robotics looking at tools we can use from the Enterprise from our partners with our DNA partners and back on what we can do to deliver small automations what I call it. We don't want to replace what's in the portfolio or what we need to change in the system. But what we can do within the processes we have today. The other thing we're looking at is um The uh tools we can use to build maturity and some of the Processes we have built within business Excellence. So think about planning think about process mapping. Some of you have been involved in the stereo logic Pilots. We've done in a couple of areas where it just Maps the whole process out for us find the areas of opportunity and we expect to keep rolling that out in other areas. Um, and then the last piece I'll touch on is Really building governance and and Monitoring and maturity also on areas of partner management, uh, how we really work with our partners how we make sure they are accountable. We are accountable to make sure they work for us too. It's not just their fault all the time, right? Um looking at affordability having a continued to build a stronger framework of governance around that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And um Following, um how we can use again the Innovations to do more audits. And more audit lines, um in an easier way so a lot going on a lot of balls in here all the time. Yes. Thank you, um hard to believe but I believe next year is your 20 year anniversary of this Sigma. Congratulations. And can you share with me? Maybe 1 of your most memorable moments in your career? Yeah. So, um, I'm going to cheat and say actually I have to have more years of experience with Sigma. Um, I was a consultant before before I became an employee working in India. That was my first job in my career and The fondest memory I have and 1 of the biggest turning points in my career and life was Master leader 2003.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Post trip outside India first time visiting a client And first time really working in a global company in on the business side because I was a developer back then really working on coding but I'm like, okay, let's step out of that and understand what I'm working with. Um, and that work was to bring up. I'm not making it up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And then I always have memories of that.

So we give service to all book of business and we use all the ecosystem that full ecosystem is our ecosystem in a daily basis. So that make Our life quite complex. So that's 1 of the things that um, we're working on discovering also on our side. What is the need right from all of the systems from a provider perspective? So we are a customer and client Focus company and that's not going to change but um, the purpose of PSO is to actually build those Partnerships right with our um, uh Network providers to um enable that experience right for for our customers. And today the work that we do in a daily basis is very complex. So that's why we are partnering with lofty with uh with trunk with seed to make it easier also for our employees to serve our providers so that it will be the first 1 that comes to mind. Um, the second 1 will be the communication. So stakeholder management. We once again serve all the book of business. So, um, everyone has a piece in PSO Rite that is impacting on them.

So I have a 3 year old and you know and I guess it would be the same for you guys right where your loved ones are. That's your favorite place, but there is 1 spot that I discover in a trip in in Australia and there is there are 2 beaches that are together. There is a 7 Mile Beach and the high ammo Speed high is specifically is like is amazing. So I would recommend you I won't send the link where it is because it's a little bit like a wild place. There's no um, there's no 1, you know taking care of the beach. So it's like a very so you need to be careful with the sharks because the shark but it's beautiful beautiful spot. So I will choose that 1&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Hi, Sean some questions for you. Um, you have recently moved over and from a financial role including Network. Um, which is a bit unusual. If you were giving a young person career advice. Would you steer them towards a finance role or would you give them having sample Network now? Would you give them a steer the more the&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is a tough 1. I get well I was going to say as a as a younger person myself. I probably want to be like a professional footballer and then seeing Scotland recently. I think I might well have a chance. But um Yeah, so Network, um, actually I'm glad that someone's didn't say I was 1 of the challenges there and for um, it's interesting the way you put the question. So, um, Sigma actually has a pretty good, um history of of moving people from Finance into other roles, right look at even the senior leaders. So David cardi B of Vancouver Palmer, they come from Finance programs into bigger roles. And so um, it's there has been those sort of situations where you given the opportunity to do. So, um personally, I have really enjoyed getting to work with the network team and get exposure and I I want it to be closer to the business and um, I'm definitely got that I've got a huge appreciation much greater appreciation for what the network team do so a shout out to them just because they do a fantastic job. Um To to the point of the question. I I do still think that having the finance background particularly in the work that we do really helps just understand the nature of um, the business the economic model how our products work. Um, so it actually gives you um a kind of an opportunity to to use those skills in other parts. So I'm biased maybe to towards I would still say Finance is a very good foundation. And it helps you get into the business Cigna especially gives you the opportunity to do that. But after the Delta, so the last question of the day is if you could be an animal. What animal would you be and why? More importantly why why is important? Yeah. Monkey&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since I was really young. Climbing and um, I would always like try and climb trees. I would get in trouble for it. I fell out of trees numerous times. Um, I was always like just trying to climb up there and swing up it so then I kind of got called a monkey and it is my favorite animal so I would quite like whom&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So I guess thanks everyone for all the questions and thanks for the the leadership team for your responses. Maybe a nickname there Sean. Absolutely. Okay, so I'll hand overnight um to seventh&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, so let's uh, let's&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It's really important that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Spend some time talking about uh, what's going on in ihds especially what we've been hearing from you.
