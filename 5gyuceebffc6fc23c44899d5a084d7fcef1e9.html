And across the valley, he sees not only uncles, cousins and friends. He sees gurus, he sees the teachers that taught them (and you know how the hindues revered these relationships ).</div><div>He sees them, and Krishna (one of the expressions of the deity) he says to him:</div><div><u>You&rsquo;ll never untangle the circumstances that brought you to this moment. You are a warrior</u>; arise now, my dear warrior, with the full understanding that all there been already killed <i>all there will be killed</i>, and so yourself. </div><div><u>This is just a theater play, this is my will. You are you cut up in the circumstances that I determined for you. And did you don&rsquo;t determined for yourself.</u></div><div>So arise, you noble warrior. Embrace your destiny, your fate. Stand up and do your duty.</div></content></body></html>
