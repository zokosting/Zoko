Aida was asking me that this project has to be continued of course not at the moment but like soon and and she asked me about the state pages of and they can continue and so far. I just don't know you know, and but we have to continue at some point. So it's not like that they disappear, you know what I mean? So we just we have to continue example and then and they are blending in the background stuff. And I'm just wondering when they are coming to us and know we needed and I hope that this will not be a bad moment and we are full of those other things. I don't know in particular that he was actually it was just I think it was some campaign SME campaign. I guess okay of a blinding something with an agency in everything, but it's all on hold moment, and I guess they wanted like a landing page from us. I think it's only saying that they know or new fixtures already got new section on the side you had added two things is like this. There's a campaign for smes and I think this Library you notice cancel library, but this is another thing. Yeah, I think they also have a cafe here. So they are there a lot of things. Because you know nothing that would like need like a month or something and creating it but It would be something additional. It's definitely again at the catch up for me keeping with that was just part of my life. So I just wanted to check with him at how we're going to manage that stuff. Over hundred Project Blog and you can't commit to all of them. So we have to prioritize anyone can do it, but it's going to come we're going to pick it up again very quickly, but he must be prepared to yeah, that would be cool Joe and I think like afterwards we can stick with the markets and just ask them about their priorities, you know, like what they see the most important thing from the list or something like that and then we can see what we can do or not. Not sure like how <div><br></div>To organize that at the end. Yeah. No, I'm I think Chris is what jr. He might have an approach to Louis. So just figure it out. Okay, because we can't commit to all of them. I think it's ridiculous and also quite a lot of them didn't even have dates against them. They were like all different they want to do but they don't know what yeah. So do you do you think that they all in contact with Louise than like the different Market to HP and Spain and then we can directly talk with Louise and she Give us information. I'm not entirely sure. I don't know. What would be the easiest if they just communicate like we some Second Son think that way but I think they could delete stuff out and they'll expect something and then to go to tell them something different. You know what it's like. <div><br></div>And then they're better than covid Y which is what a member has requested. So little for the we've waited been there for them to come to help us. I think I do think the Christmas will be working with her now, but I think it wasn't pick up again in terms of how it's going to work out and operate their I think he's got an idea. It's just making sure we know what that is sooner rather than later then And plan accordingly as well because we've got load the project on now, but quite big called how many for one thing it be too much to manage and third column protect the team to make sure that we're not stretched too thin and you're not over-promising and then we under-deliver because already Yeah, no, no obstacle thing because of my update. There's no one has anything else we can help us? And I'll also for that time in our story for the two-hour practically walked three. Okay? Perfect. Thank God. They say send me an email or call me if you need my help on anything. Stay safe. </div></content></body></html>
